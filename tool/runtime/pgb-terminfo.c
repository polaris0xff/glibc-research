/* pgb-terminfo.c -- give a static binary a terminal description on a host
 * that has no terminfo database, or has one without the entry it needs.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, MEASURED IN poc/20-nano AND docs/limitations.md §3
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ncurses reaches terminal descriptions by PATH, not by code. A `setupterm()`
 * probe linked against the same static ncursesw, across the eleven pinned
 * environments:
 *
 *     OK                                    all 7 glibc
 *     rc=-1 err=-1  no database at all      Alpine 3.10, 3.20, 3.22
 *     rc=-1 err=0   database present, no
 *                   xterm-256color entry    Void musl
 *
 * ⚠ THE TWO FAILURES ARE DIFFERENT AND THE SECOND IS THE INTERESTING ONE.
 * "No database" is the obvious case. "A database that does not describe THIS
 * terminal" is the one an embedded copy has to handle too, and a mechanism
 * that only checked for the directory would miss it.
 *
 * ⛔ WHETHER A glibc PORTABILITY TOOL SHOULD OWN A TERMINAL DATABASE IS A
 * REAL QUESTION AND THE ANSWER HERE IS "ONLY IF ASKED". docs/limitations.md
 * §3 says the argument is weak, and it is: terminfo is ncurses' data, not
 * libc's. So this is opt-in (`--embed-terminfo`), it is off by default, and
 * it embeds a HANDFUL of entries rather than a database -- enough that a
 * terminal program is usable, not enough to pretend to be /usr/share/terminfo.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM, AND WHY IT IS A CONSTRUCTOR
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ncurses resolves a terminal in this order: $TERMINFO (a single directory),
 * $TERMINFO_DIRS (a search list), $HOME/.terminfo, then its compiled-in
 * default. So pointing it at a directory is the whole interface, exactly as
 * LOCPATH is for glibc locales and SSL_CERT_FILE is for OpenSSL.
 *
 * ⭐ AND THE HOST COMES FIRST, for the same reason as pgb-cacert.c: a host
 * that has a real database has a BETTER one than five embedded entries, and
 * a description an administrator installed must win. This only acts when the
 * host cannot answer for $TERM.
 *
 * ⛔ IT WRITES TO THE FILESYSTEM, which is why it is opt-in. Same tier as
 * --embed-locale and for the same reason.
