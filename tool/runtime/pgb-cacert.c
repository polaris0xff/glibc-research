/* pgb-cacert.c -- give a static binary a TLS trust store on a host whose
 * store is not where the binary was told to look.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, MEASURED IN poc/30-curl AND docs/limitations.md §3
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A TLS library compiles in exactly ONE default bundle path, chosen when IT
 * was built. Every distribution puts the bundle somewhere else. Measured
 * across the eleven pinned environments, with the harness's own CA variables
 * unset, on a curl built against OpenSSL in the pinned Debian environment:
 *
 *     verified     5 of 11
 *     unverified   Debian 11, Debian 12, Ubuntu 20.04 (no bundle at all in
 *                  the minimal image); Rocky 8 (/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt);
 *                  openSUSE Leap (/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem);
 *                  Alpine 3.10 (/etc/ssl/cert.pem)
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A FOURTH, SEPARATE DEPENDENCY, and it is not glibc's. Fixing NSS,
 * iconv and locale touches none of it. It is DATA reached by PATH, which is
 * why static linking is silent about it.
 *
 * ⛔ AND IT IS THE ONE WHERE FAILING OPEN WOULD BE A SECURITY BUG. A shim
 * that "helpfully" disabled verification, or that trusted a bundle it could
 * not find, would turn a connection error into a silent downgrade. Nothing
 * here ever disables anything: it only ever tells the TLS library WHERE a
 * store is, and if it cannot find one it changes nothing and lets the
 * program's own error stand.
 *
 * THE FIX, IN TWO LAYERS, AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE IMPORTANT ONE
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. ⭐ FIND THE HOST'S STORE. Six of the eleven failures above are not
 *    "this machine has no certificates", they are "this machine keeps them
 *    somewhere else". Probing the known locations costs nothing, writes
 *    nothing, embeds nothing, and -- crucially -- KEEPS THE HOST'S OWN TRUST
 *    DECISIONS, including any root an administrator added or removed.
 *
 * 2. Materialise an embedded copy, ONLY where layer 1 found nothing. That is
 *    the three minimal Debian/Ubuntu images, which genuinely ship no bundle.
 *
 * ⛔ THE EMBEDDED COPY AGES AND THAT IS A REAL HAZARD, stated here rather
 * than discovered later. It is a snapshot of the pinned build environment's
 * ca-certificates package taken at build time. Roots get revoked and expire.
 * A binary carrying a two-year-old bundle, running on a host that HAS a
 * current one, must not use the stale copy -- which is exactly why layer 1
 * runs first and layer 2 is a fallback, never a pre-emption. Same rule as
 * pgb-locale.c, for a stronger reason.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY A CONSTRUCTOR AND NOT A --wrap. There is no single function to wrap:
 * OpenSSL reads SSL_CERT_FILE inside SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths(),
 * curl reads CURL_CA_BUNDLE in its own initialisation, GnuTLS has its own
 * path, and an application may call any of them or none. The environment is
 * the one interface all of them already agree on, so this sets the variables
 * before main() and lets each library find them the way it already does.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT IT WILL NOT DO:
 *   - it never OVERWRITES a variable the caller set. If SSL_CERT_FILE is
 *     already in the environment, this file does nothing at all;
 *   - it never sets a path that does not exist;
 *   - it never touches the filesystem unless the host has no store AND the
 *     binary was built with --embed-cacert;
 *   - it does not help a TLS library that ignores the environment. That is a
 *     real gap and it is not papered over.
