/*
 * pgb-tzdata.c - carry a handful of timezone descriptions, for hosts with none.
 *
 * -- THE PROBLEM, MEASURED --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `experiments/97-timezone.sh`: static glibc carries NO timezone data. libc.a
 * names /usr/share/zoneinfo, /etc/localtime and honours TZDIR, and reads all
 * three from the HOST. Four of this project's eleven target environments ship
 * no zone database at all -- alpine 3.10, 3.20, 3.22 and ubuntu-20.04, which
 * is glibc, so this is not a musl story.
 *
 * ⛔ AND THE FAILURE IS SILENT AND WORSE THAN "IT RETURNS UTC". With no
 * database glibc re-reads TZ=Europe/Berlin as a POSIX zone SPECIFICATION -- a
 * bare abbreviation with no offset -- and strftime prints
 *
 *     Europe +0000
 *
 * the zone name the caller ASKED FOR, with a UTC offset. %Z, the field that
 * looks like a confirmation, is an echo of the input; only the offset carries
 * the defect. That is the same class as gconv: a wrong answer at the point of
 * USE, long after any startup check has passed.
 *
 * -- WHAT THIS DOES ---------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The same shape as pgb-terminfo.c, because glibc honours TZDIR exactly as
 * ncurses honours TERMINFO:
 *
 *   1. a caller who set TZDIR is left alone -- that is their business;
 *   2. ⭐ THE HOST FIRST, ALWAYS. A real zone database is better than a
 *      handful of embedded files, and an administrator's tzdata must win;
 *   3. otherwise the embedded files are written under $TMPDIR and TZDIR is
 *      pointed at them, with setenv's overwrite flag 0 so a caller's value is
 *      never replaced.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS A HANDFUL, NOT A DATABASE, and the binary says so. tzdata is ~1,800
 * files; carrying all of them would multiply a 2 MB static binary. The set is
 * `cfg.DefaultTzdataZones`, overridable with PGB_TZDATA_ZONES at build time.
 * A zone that is not carried behaves exactly as it does today, which is the
 * honest floor: this closes the case it carries and no other.
 *
 * ⚠ A ZONE NAME HAS A DIRECTORY IN IT -- "Europe/Berlin", "America/New_York".
 * Unlike terminfo's single letter subdirectory this needs the leading path
 * components created, and the writer below creates exactly the ones the names
 * require rather than assuming one level: "America/Indiana/Indianapolis" is a
 * real zone with two.
