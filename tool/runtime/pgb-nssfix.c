/* pgb-nssfix.c -- stop a static glibc binary loading the host's NSS modules.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, MEASURED IN experiments/20-static-glibc-nss-dlopen.sh
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A `gcc -static` glibc binary still reads the HOST's /etc/nsswitch.conf at
 * runtime and dlopen()s whatever it names. Those modules are ordinary shared
 * objects carrying DT_NEEDED libc.so.6, so a second libc and the dynamic
 * loader enter a process that `file` calls "statically linked" and `ldd` calls
 * "not a dynamic executable".
 *
 * Across the 11 pinned environments this happens on 5 and KILLS the process on
 * 2 of them, Arch Linux (SIGFPE via libnss_mymachines, from `hosts:`) and
 * openSUSE Leap 15.6 (SIGFPE via libnss_compat, from `passwd:` -- so this is
 * not only a DNS problem). Fedora 42 loads two host modules and survives,
 * which is worse for a shipper than a clean failure would be.
 *
 * THE FIX
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * __nss_configure_lookup() replaces the service line for one database,
 * in-process, before any lookup happens. It is a PUBLIC glibc symbol
 * (versioned GLIBC_2.2.5) and it is present in libc.a, which is what makes it
 * usable from a static link at all.
 *
 * Pointed at services that glibc 2.34 and later implement INSIDE libc --
 * `files` for every database and `files dns` for hosts -- there is nothing
 * left to dlopen. Measured: zero host NSS modules on all 11 environments, DNS
 * still resolving.
 *
 * ⛔ THE GLIBC 2.34 FLOOR IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT A DETAIL. Before 2.34 `files`
 * and `dns` were themselves separate libnss_*.so files, so this override moves
 * the dlopen rather than removing it. experiments/21-glibc-version-floor.sh
 * measures that directly. The build environment pins a glibc at or above 2.34
 * for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY GIVES UP. A program built this way cannot see
 * LDAP, SSSD, NIS, mDNS or systemd-resolved user and host databases. That is
 * the whole point -- those are the host modules being kept out -- but it is a
 * real behaviour change and it is documented in docs/limitations.md rather
 * than buried here. A program that MUST see enterprise directory data is
 * outside the class this tool serves.
