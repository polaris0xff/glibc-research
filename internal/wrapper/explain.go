WHERE IT IS INJECTED
  Not into your source and not into your build files. pgb puts a directory of
  compiler wrappers first on PATH and sets CC/CXX to them, so autotools,
  CMake, meson and plain make all pick it up without knowing pgb exists.
  `+"`pgb cc-dir`"+` prints that directory. Each wrapper is pgb itself under
  another name; the flags it injects are in %s beside it, in plain JSON.

  Each wrapper looks at its own argv and decides:
    -c / -E / -S / -M      a compile.  compile flags only
    -shared                a shared library.  PASSED THROUGH UNCHANGED
    -print-* / --version   a query.  PASSED THROUGH UNCHANGED
    anything else          an executable link.  link flags added
  Passing -shared through is what lets a normal ./configure run: its shared
  library probes must keep working or the build fails before it starts.

COMPILE FLAGS
  These LEAD the command line, so they are DEFAULTS and your own flags
  override them. Link flags below still trail, because link order is meaning.

  -fno-plt                       no procedure linkage table indirection
  -march=%-22s CPU baseline. NOT -march=native. A binary built
                                 with -march=native runs on the machine that
                                 built it and crashes elsewhere with SIGILL,
                                 which looks exactly like a portability bug in
                                 this tool and is not one.

  AND THE ONE FLAG OF YOURS pgb REWRITES: -march=native becomes -march=%s,
  -mtune=native and -mcpu=native become -mtune=generic. Any OTHER -march you
  pass wins, because a project compiling one file per ISA level behind a
  runtime CPU check is doing the right thing.

LINK FLAGS
  -static                        no interpreter, no DT_NEEDED, nothing to
                                 resolve on the host
  -Wl,--eh-frame-hdr             gcc DROPS this for every -static link, so a
                                 static executable normally has no
                                 PT_GNU_EH_FRAME. GNU libgcc does not need it

                                 finds nothing, and the failure is

  <pgb-nssfix.o>                 passed as a plain object, not from an archive

                                 referenced symbol is dropped by the linker,
                                 and an nssfix that silently did not link is

WHAT pgb DOES NOT DO, AND WILL NOT PRETEND TO
  - It does not make dlopen() of host plugins work. A static binary that
    dlopens a host shared object pulls a second libc in, which is the failure
    this tool exists to avoid. A program whose CORE function is loading host
    plugins is outside the class pgb serves. docs/limitations.md is explicit.
  - It does not give you NSS data from LDAP, SSSD, NIS or systemd-resolved.
    Keeping those modules out is the fix, and losing them is its cost.
  - It does not lower the kernel ABI floor. Your build glibc decides that.
