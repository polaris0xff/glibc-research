"""Rank the glibc ABI by real-world demand.

Joins the Debian popcon vote counts with the pinned snapshot's package index,
downloads the most-used library packages, scans their dynamic symbol imports,
and reports which demanded glibc symbols the bridge serves natively, which
resolve into abort stubs, and which are absent from the inventory — each
weighted by the votes of the packages demanding it. The output is the
priority queue for extending the bridge.
