# nothing about the LAYOUT inside them, and 40-appimage.sh's whole A/B is one cp
# into one path. Upstream rebuilt this AppImage and the layout moved under it,
# twice over. docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.17 has both, measured.

# ------------------------------------------------ 1. the dispatcher slot ----
# The one file the A/B replaces. ⚠ Upstream RENAMED it: builds up to and
# including sha256 712766f8 shipped lib/foreign-dlopen.so, and the build
# verified today ships lib/cross-libc-dlopen.so instead. Accept either BY NAME
# and print which was found. Guessing is worse than refusing here, because a
# wrong guess makes every case below measure an AppDir nobody patched.

# --------------------------------------------------------- 2. the preload ---
# ⛔ TWO FILES, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THE POINT.
#
#   .preload.shipped   what the AppImage actually ships, byte for byte. A
#                      record, never restored from.
#   .preload.baseline  the same list with THIS PROJECT'S OWN forwarding shims
#                      removed. What the cases restore from.
#
# ⚠ Measured, and it is why the second file exists. The pinned build now names
# gl-fwd.so, egl-fwd.so and gles-fwd.so in its own .preload: upstream adopted
# them. Section J restores the baseline and then APPENDS the one shim under
# test, so with them already present every case whose whole point is the
# shim's ABSENCE would have run with upstream's copy of it, appended a
# duplicate line, and passed. Nothing would have reported anything.
#
# ⭐ What is removed is printed, on every run. A suite that edits the artefact
# under test and does not say so is worse than one that refuses.

# --------------------------------------------------- 3. the bundled glibc ---
# Out of libc's own banner. grep -a rather than `strings`, which is in binutils
# and is not installed here: the version this whole report is written against
# printed as an empty string for as long as that went unnoticed, which is the
# quietest possible way to be wrong.
