# A real application, the third dispatcher, and the HOST-DRIVERS shape.
#
# 47-gtk4.sh measures the SELF-CONTAINED gtk4 demo, which bundles its own Mesa
# and its own vendor library, so gles-fwd forwards to the BUNDLED dispatcher
# because the bundle can stand on its own. This is the same application built
# the other way: a host-drivers AppImage, glvnd dispatchers and no Mesa. On a
# classic host there is no libGLESv2.so.2 at all (Alpine folds GLES into
# libEGL.so.1, reachable only through eglGetProcAddress) and no glvnd vendor,
# so gles-fwd's target selection fell through to the bundled dispatcher, whose
# GLES entry points are no-ops without a vendor behind them. GTK4's renderer is
# GLES, so it segfaulted. This is the case docs/report/10-measured-versus-assumed.md
# recorded as measured-but-not-repaired, and it is why GLFWD_ALT_SONAME exists.
