# ------------------------------------ F. a CLOSED-SOURCE driver, real silicon
#
# Everything above runs against open-source Mesa: inspectable, rebuildable, and
# when it broke, its __FILE__ strings and a -dbgsym package said where. This
# section is the one class of host library none of that is true for.
#
# The target is NVIDIA's WSL CUDA userspace, reachable through /dev/dxg. Read
# the results in this order, because the headline is not the one you expect:
#
#   E41/E41b  it works, AND SO DOES THE CONTROL. A vendor ships against the
#             oldest floor it can (this one is GLIBC_2.2.5), so a proprietary
#             driver is the LEAST likely host library to need this fix. The
#             claim these two cases support is the regression claim.
#   E42       zero rewrites, for the same reason, from a real vendor binary.
#   E43a/E43  what the vendor stack DOES need. As shipped, two objects in one
#             driver stack bind two different implementations of five condvar
#             entry points. This turns that into one.
#   E44/E45   and what it needs more: on a real WSL host /usr/lib/wsl/lib is
#             reachable ONLY through /etc/ld.so.cache, which this ld.so is
#             patched to ignore. The symptom is not "cannot open library", it
#             is CUDA reporting no device at all.

# packages it as dri/d3d12_dri.so. That makes the host's own OpenGL driver a
# hardware driver, and the AppImage's bundled libglvnd has a real vendor library
# to dlopen at last.
#
# E53a is the third independent sighting of one bug. The AppImage fails on this
# driver with `glXCreateContext failed`, which reads like a display or driver
# fault and is neither: d3d12_dri.so dlopens libd3d12.so by BARE SONAME, sharun

#
# Everything above measures ONE boundary. The bundled Vulkan loader dlopens the
# host's ICD; the ICD was built against another libc; cross-libc-dlopen.so carries
# it across. That is a LIBC gap, and the host had the thing all along.
#
# The AppDir contains eight other objects that dlopen something (E59), and one
# of them fails a different way. libglvnd's libGL.so.1 is a DISPATCHER: it
# dlopens a VENDOR library, libGLX_<vendor>.so.0, and a host whose Mesa was
# built without glvnd does not ship one AT ALL. No amount of libc bridging can
# carry a file that does not exist. That is an INTERFACE gap, and the repair is
# a different one: replace the bundled dispatcher (src/gl-fwd.c).
#
# This section was previously one line: E38, SKIPPED, with the reason "that
# gap is host packaging, not libc" and the verdict "not fixable from a loader
# shim". The reason was true. The verdict was never tested, and it was wrong.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- T-12 ---
# ⛔ THE INSTRUMENTATION EXISTED AND NOTHING READ IT BACK. run() has been
# recording each case's wall time to $TIMINGS since T-12 was opened, and until
# the suite first completed there was nothing to read: no run ever reached the
# end. This prints it.
#
# Every `timeout` in this file is a wall-clock value tuned on one developer
# machine, and ⚠ a timeout is scored as a FAILURE rather than a skip, so a slow
# shared runner reads as a regression. ⛔ The rule when one is close is RAISE,
# never shorten: shortening hides the problem and makes the failure mode less
# legible. docs/todo/infrastructure.md T-12 holds the measured-versus-configured
# table, per runner, taken from these lines.
#
# ⚠ The margin column is against the SMALLEST timeout in this file, not against
# the one that case actually carries, because a case's timeout is written
# inline in its own command and is not knowable here. It is a floor on the
# margin, so a case that looks safe by this column is safe by its own.
