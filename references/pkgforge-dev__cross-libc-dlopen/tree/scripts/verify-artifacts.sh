# THREE PROPERTIES, and each one fails silently if it is wrong rather than
# loudly, which is why they are checked rather than assumed:
#
#   SONAME        a forwarding shim whose SONAME is not the library it
#                 replaces still loads. ld.so simply never binds anything to
#                 it, so it forwards nothing and nothing says why.
#   export count  a shim exporting fewer entry points than its table declares
#                 hands some application `undefined symbol`, not at load,
#                 but at whichever call the missing one turns out to be.
#   max GLIBC_    an artefact needing a symbol version newer than the floor
#                 loads fine on the machine that built it and fails inside a
#                 bundle whose glibc is older. This is THE floor rule.

# ⭐ FATAL: the endbr64 instrumentation, which is what -fcf-protection=full
# actually delivers. A build where the flag was dropped, by an edit or by
# the Makefile's CET_CFLAGS failing to resolve on a host whose compiler does
# a compiler that does not answer -dumpmachine the expected way, produces a shim with none, and
# nothing else here would notice. x86-64 only: CET is an x86 feature and the
# aarch64 shim correctly has no endbr64 at all.
#
# ⚠ REPORTED, NOT FATAL: the .note.gnu.property IBT note, which is absent.
# The reason is measured, and it is not the one this check used to give.
# `-fcf-protection=full` alone emits no note on bullseye (gcc 10.2), bookworm
# (12.2) or trixie (14.2), because glibc's crti.o carries no property on any
# of the three, and the linker ANDs that absence across the link.
# ⛔ `-Wl,-z,ibt,-z,shstk` DOES emit one on all three, and the note it emits is
# FALSE: _init and _fini come from crti.o/crtn.o, ld.so reaches them through
# DT_INIT and DT_FINI, an indirect call, and neither begins with endbr64.
# Forcing the note would assert a property the object does not have, which is
# worse than not having the note. docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.13 has the full table.
#
# ⚠ The `portable` variant asks for NO CET, so there the expectation inverts:
# endbr64 present would mean --portable did not reach the compile. Both arms
# are asserted, because a check that only knows one of them cannot tell a
# working variant from a broken flag.

	# removed has 3472. The flag accounts for six of them. The other 3472 are
	# the trampolines' own, spelled as literal bytes in gl-fwd.c so the
	# floor's assembler cannot be too old for them, and no compiler flag
	# removes those.
	#
	# So a count over zero says nothing about whether the flag arrived, and a

	# the manifest records the variant; docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.13 has both figures.
