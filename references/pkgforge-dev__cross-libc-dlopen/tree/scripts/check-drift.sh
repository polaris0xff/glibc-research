# Do the documents still describe the tree?
#
# ⭐ More than one agent works on this repository, and they do not all have the
# same care. A convention that is only written down is followed by whoever read
# it; a convention with a check behind it is followed by everyone. This is the
# mechanical half of "documentation ships with the code it describes".
#
# Five questions, each reported separately so the failure names itself:
#
#   1. Every CROSS_LIBC_DLOPEN_* control the code reads is documented, and
#      every one the documents name is actually read. ⭐ This is the one that
#      matters most: a switch that stops working is invisible, because the
#      documented name and the read name look identical from either side.
#   2. Every repository path a document cites exists.
#   3. Every `make` target a document names exists in src/Makefile.
#   4. No dash is used as punctuation, in markdown prose or in a comment.
#      See docs/conventions/prose.md.

# ------------------------------------------- 2. cited paths still exist -----
head_ "cited paths"

# Repository-relative paths in backticks, anchored on a real top-level
# directory so /usr/lib and $APPDIR/lib are not mistaken for citations.
#
# ⛔ THE PREFIX IS WHY THIS MISSED ONE. The first version of this anchored the
# path on the opening backtick and required a closing backtick straight after
# it, so it only ever saw a path cited alone. This repository's most common
# citation is not that shape: it is a COMMAND, `sh scripts/check-drift.sh`,
# and every one of those was invisible. docs/conventions/prose.md named
# `sh scripts/check-prose-dashes.sh` as the dash ratchet for the whole life of
# the branch. No such script has ever existed. The check that exists to catch
# a stale citation could not see a stale citation about itself.
#
# So: allow any run of backtick-free, space-terminated words between the
# opening backtick and the path, and drop the closing-backtick requirement so
# a path followed by its arguments still counts. Then pull the path back out
# of whatever matched.
#
# ⚠ `*` IS IN THE PATH CLASS ON PURPOSE. `src/gl-fwd-*.h` is a class of files,
# not a file, and the skip below drops it. Leave `*` out and the class stops
# at the hyphen, the wildcard skip never sees a wildcard, and the check
# reports `src/gl-fwd-` missing. That is not hypothetical: it is what the
# widened pattern did on its first run.
#
# ⚠ These paths belong to ANOTHER project and are cited as that project's own
# files: the first three are onelf's, which is Rust and has no src/main.rs
# here, and the fourth is Azathothas/TEMPLATE's, which docs/AGENTS.md cites at
# a URL and says in the same sentence is not in this tree. `tests/bindprobe`
# is ours and is a BUILT binary, so it is cited as a command and is not, and
# should not be, a tracked file.
# Exempt BY NAME rather than by pattern, so adding one is a deliberate act and
# a typo in a path of ours is still caught.
# ⚠ THREE MORE ARE BUILT BINARIES, cited in their own source's usage line the
# way a reader would type them. tests/abi-host.c builds tests/abi-host, and the
# same for cudaprobe and soak. The .c is tracked and the binary is not, and
# should not be.
#
# ⚠ scripts/common/check-no-secrets.sh belongs to Azathothas/TEMPLATE and is
# fetched at a URL by .github/workflows/secret-sweep.yml, which names that URL
# on the same line.

# ⚠ A FENCED BLOCK IS A TRANSCRIPT, NOT A CITATION, and this check skips one.
# docs/report/README.md's evidence is quoted command output, and output that records a

# job is to record a broken-path finding is the one document that cannot quote
# it. Measured before the exemption went in: 88 paths cited with fences read,
# 88 with fences skipped, and no path anywhere in the tree is cited ONLY inside
# a fence. It costs no coverage on this tree. Backticks in running text are
# still read, which is where a stale citation actually misleads somebody.
