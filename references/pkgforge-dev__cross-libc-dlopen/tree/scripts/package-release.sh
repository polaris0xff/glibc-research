# ⛔ IT VERIFIES, IT DOES NOT RECOMPUTE. Every artefact's sha256 is already in
# build-manifest.json, written by scripts/verify-artifacts.sh at build time.
# This reads that value and CHECKS the file against it. Recomputing would
# produce a number that agrees with the file and says nothing about whether the
# file is the one the verifier passed, and a release whose checksums disagree
# with its own manifest is the defect this ordering exists to prevent.
#
# ⛔ NO NESTED DIRECTORY INSIDE THE ARCHIVES. An extract drops the files where
# the user is standing. Nothing here needs a directory: it is five objects, a
# manifest and a licence, all of which a consumer copies into one place.
#
# ⭐ "Each artefact ships three ways" is read as: loose, or out of the tar, or
# out of the zip. Each of the five is a separate loose asset, and both archives
# carry the whole set. Five one-file archives times two formats would be
# fifteen assets per architecture that nobody wants separately.
