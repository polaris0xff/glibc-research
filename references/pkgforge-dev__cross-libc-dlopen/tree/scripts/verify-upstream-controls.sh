# Did the rename turn a control into a silent pass?
#
# ⛔ THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR. E30, E37a and E43a drive UPSTREAM's binary,
# the shim shipped inside the demo AppImage, not this project's. Upstream only
# understands the old ANYLINUX_* variable names. If the harness stops sending
# them, upstream runs with the feature OFF.
#
# ⚠ And that does not produce a failure. E30 predicts NO-DEVICES; upstream with
# the feature off ALSO reports NO-DEVICES. The case goes green having measured
# nothing at all.
#
# ⭐ So the check is not whether the case passes. It is whether upstream's own
# debug lines appear. This runs both arms and prints the counts.

#
# Needs the extracted AppDir and the floor build, which
# scripts/run-appimage.sh produces in .tmp.
