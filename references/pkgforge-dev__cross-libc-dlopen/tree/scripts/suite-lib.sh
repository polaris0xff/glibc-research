# Shared by scripts/run-evidence.sh and scripts/run-appimage.sh: everything the
# two PowerShell orchestrators did that was NOT sequencing.
#
# ⛔ THREE BEHAVIOURS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING. They live in the orchestration
# layer rather than in a stage, so a port that only translated the sequencing
# would drop them and quietly change what the suite measures:
#
#   1. sha256 of every downloaded AppImage, verified against the digest the
#      release API publishes, refusing to continue on a mismatch. The suite's
#      whole premise is that it drove a KNOWN binary. There is no checked-in
#      pin: the demo tag is rolling, so the release API is the only authority.
#   2. a stage script containing CR is REJECTED, not run. A CR turns a shell
#      script into a $'...\r' "not found" error that names the wrong thing and
#      reads like anything but line endings.
#   3. the GPU capability is PROBED by running a container, not inferred from
#      the host. The engine may be a WSL2 VM, a Linux daemon or a remote
#      socket, and only the container's own view decides. The answer is what
#      makes ten cases run or SKIP by name.
#
# Not executable on its own; dot-sourced.

# ------------------------------------------------------ 1. container engine --
# podman and docker interchangeably. No hardcoded path: the PowerShell version
# carried one Windows machine's podman location, which is a local convenience
# and has no business in a script other people run.

}

# ------------------------------------------------------------ 2. CR refusal --
# ⚠ tr and cmp, NOT grep. Measured on this machine: a CR pattern built with
# $(printf '\r') matches nothing at all, so the grep form of this check reads
# GREEN over a file that demonstrably contains a CR. Carrying the PowerShell
# orchestrator's CR refusal across in that form would have carried it across as
# a no-op, looking exactly like the original and measuring nothing. This asks a
# different question: if deleting every CR changes the file, it had one.

      file report 'not found' while naming something else entirely."

# --------------------------------------------------------------- 3. the GPU --

# then SKIP by name, which is the mechanism CI needs and it already exists.

# ⭐ WHAT GITHUB SAYS THE ASSET IS, which is the only authority there is for a
# rolling tag. The release API publishes a sha256 per asset, so it can be read
# without downloading anything. Printing nothing on any failure is deliberate:
# this only ever ADDS a sentence to a refusal, and a suite that cannot reach
# the network must still be able to refuse.
#
# ⚠ awk over `tr ',' '\n'`, not jq and not python3. The suite runs on a hosted
# runner, in Git Bash on Windows and inside four container images, and jq is
# not on all of them. Splitting on commas cuts through string values too; that
# is harmless here because the only lines this reads are a name and a digest,
# and their order in the response is what identifies the pair.

# ⛔ THE SUITE CARRIES NO PIN, AND THAT IS THE POLICY. The upstream publishes
# one release and its tag is `demo`; the assets are replaced without notice,
# so a checked-in digest is stale before it lands and every run would need a
# re-pin to survive. The only ground truth is what the release API publishes
# today: upstream_digest reads it, and this function requires the bytes to
# match it.
#
# ⚠ The API is read BEFORE a cached copy is trusted, so a cache hit from an
# earlier run is re-verified and re-downloaded when the tag has moved.
# Measured, and it is why this exists: run 32948154287 refused with "sha256 is
# 8f6e390a..., expected 712766f8..." after the asset had been replaced, and
# every asset on that release was replaced AGAIN 56 seconds after the run
# ended. docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.15.
