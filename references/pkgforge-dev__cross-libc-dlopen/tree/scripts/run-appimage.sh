# The end-to-end proof: a real AppImage using a real HOST graphics driver on a
# host whose libc is not the AppImage's.
#
# run-evidence.sh measures the mechanism in isolation. This measures the thing
# users actually complain about, on real software, across four host classes and
# a second AppImage:
#
#   debian:bullseye-slim  builds the artefacts on the glibc 2.31 FLOOR
#   alpine:3.22           musl host, the case the complaint is about
#   debian:trixie-slim    glibc 2.41, OLDER than the bundled 2.44, so nothing
#                         NEEDS rewriting. The regression case.
#   ubuntu:14.04          pre-glvnd glibc: classic Mesa, no libGLX_<vendor>,
#   ubuntu:16.04          no Vulkan. The third host CLASS.
#   gtk4-demo             a real GTK4 application that bundles its own Mesa and
#                         is the only AppDir here carrying libGLESv2.so.2
#
#   scripts/run-appimage.sh                    everything
#   scripts/run-appimage.sh --only alpine      one host
#   CLD_TARGET_ARCH=aarch64 scripts/run-appimage.sh
#
# Tens of minutes: two downloads and apt/apk on four distributions, two of
# which are from 2014 and 2016. run-evidence.sh is the fast gate; this is not.

# release and its tag is `demo`; the assets are replaced without notice, so a
# pinned digest is stale before it lands and every run would need a re-pin to
# survive. The suite reads the digest the release API publishes at run time
# and verifies the download against it, refusing on a mismatch.
# docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.15 is the policy.
