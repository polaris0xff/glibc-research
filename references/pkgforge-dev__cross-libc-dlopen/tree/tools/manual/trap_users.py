"""Which version-binding traps does a given object actually step on?

`version_traps.py` answers "which symbols in this libc are traps".  That is a
property of the libc alone and says nothing about whether anything in a real
process reaches one.  This answers the other half: given an object and the libc
it will be resolved against, which of that libc's traps does this object import,
and does it import them WITH a version or without one?

Why it matters
--------------
An unversioned reference does not get the default definition; it gets glibc's
obsolete one (../../docs/report/06-goal-2-the-last-blocker.md 6.2).  Three kinds of object have unversioned
references:

  * anything built against musl, which never had symbol versions,
  * anything `cross-libc-dlopen.c` has stripped, which is the point of the whole
    exercise, and
  * closed-source vendor blobs that were simply linked that way.

The third is the one nobody expects.  Measured on this machine, Microsoft's
`libdxcore.so` and `libd3d12.so` -- shipped inside NVIDIA's WSL driver package
and loaded by CUDA and by Mesa's d3d12 driver respectively -- have no
`.gnu.version_r` section at all and import six trapped names each.

Usage
-----
    python3 tools/manual/trap_users.py <libc.so.6> <object>...

Exit 0 always: this is a survey, not a gate.  `version_traps.py --check` is the
gate, and it runs against the libc rather than against its callers.
