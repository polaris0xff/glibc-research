/* The only thing the two sides of the cross-libc boundary agree on.
 *
 * Every field is a fixed-width type on purpose: this struct is the instrument
 * in an experiment about struct layout, so its own layout must not be one of
 * the variables. ABI_VIEW_VERSION guards against a stale guest .so being
 * loaded against a newer host driver, which would misread the table field for
 * field and report differences that are only misalignment.
 *
 * The filler lives here, as one inline function compiled into both sides from
 * identical source. That is what makes the comparison meaningful: the two
 * columns differ only because the HEADERS differ, never because two people
 * wrote two versions of the same table.
