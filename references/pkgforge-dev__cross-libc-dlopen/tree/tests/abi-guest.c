/* T1.3 to T1.7, guest half: the HOST DRIVER's side of the boundary.
 *
 * Built twice: once on Alpine, where it is a faithful musl-linked object of the
 * kind cross-libc-dlopen has to load, and once on the glibc floor as the control.
 * The musl build then has its libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 DT_NEEDED removed, which is
 * exactly what cross-libc-dlopen does, so every libc reference in it is resolved
 * from the loading process instead.
 *
 * The point of each entry point is to make a thing CROSS: memory allocated on
 * one side and released on the other, an errno set on one side and read on the
 * other, a FILE* opened on one side and written from the other, a mutex made on
 * one side and locked from the other. A size table alone would only prove the
 * headers disagree, which was never in doubt.
 *
 * Nothing here prints. The host half owns the report, and a guest that wrote to
 * stdout would be measuring stdout rather than using it.
