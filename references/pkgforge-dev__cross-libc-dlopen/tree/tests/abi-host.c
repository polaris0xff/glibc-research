/* T1.3 to T1.7, host half: the AppImage's side of the boundary.
 *
 * ../docs/report/README.md carried these five as SKIPPED and UNVERIFIED for the whole project.
 * They mattered because a host driver built against a different libc might
 * share a struct, an allocation, an errno or a FILE with the process, and if
 * the two sides disagree about any of them the damage is silent. They were once
 * called the most likely home of the rendering failure; they were not (section
 * 4.1), which lowered their priority without making them any less real.
 *
 * Against a guest library built by the OTHER libc, with its libc edge dropped:
 *
 *   T1.3  memory allocated in the guest is freed here, and the reverse
 *   T1.4  an errno set inside the guest is read here, in the same thread
 *   T1.5  a FILE* opened here is written from the guest
 *   T1.6  a mutex made here is locked there, a mutex made there is locked
 *         here, and a condition variable made here is signalled from there.
 *         ⚠ The second of those is not attempted, and is reported as a live
 *         hazard, when the two pthread_mutex_t sizes differ at all: the guest
 *         allocates its own size and the init it reaches writes ours, so the
 *         overflow is inside the guest. aarch64 is such a pair, x86-64 is not
 *   T1.7  every struct size and constant the two sides could disagree about,
 *         printed side by side, and then the divergent structs actually
 *         WRITTEN by the guest into storage this side allocated, behind a
 *         guard band, because an overrun that only happens on success is the
 *         most misleading result available (section 5)
 *
 * The size table is ground truth, not a verdict: a musl guest is EXPECTED to
 * disagree about several of them. The verdict is whether anything crosses
 * wrongly once every reference in the guest resolves to this process's libc.
 *
 *      tests/abi-host <guest.so> [expected-libc]
 *
 * The optional second argument is the libc the guest must have been built by.
 * The control build and the real build export the same names and differ only in
 * that, so without it a mixed-up build would pass while measuring glibc against
 * itself.
