/* T6.2: which DEFINITION did each object in the process actually bind?
 *
 * `LD_DEBUG=bindings` prints the version a reference ASKED for. It does not
 * print the definition the reference GOT, and for the version-binding trap
 * those are exactly the two things that differ: an unversioned reference asks
 * for nothing and receives glibc's obsolete definition (E22).
 *
 * So read the answer out of the process instead of arguing about it. For every
 * loaded object, walk its relocations, find the GOT slot for the named symbol,
 * and report the address the loader put there, then say which file that
 * address is in and, when it is libc, which VERSION of the symbol it is.
 *
 * The verdict that matters is not per object, it is per symbol across all of
 * them: if two objects in one driver stack bound different implementations of
 * one entry point, and that entry point takes a struct whose layout changed
 * between those implementations, then any such struct crossing between them is
 * read two different ways. That is the shape of the pthread_cond_t ABI change
 * of 2003, and section 4.1 is the story of it costing an afternoon.
 *
 *      tests/bindprobe <library> [--init <fn>] <symbol>...
 *
 * --init names a function called as `int fn(unsigned)` with 0 before the scan,
 * for drivers that pull the rest of their chain in lazily on first use
 * (libcuda.so.1 dlopens libdxcore.so and the real driver from inside cuInit).
 *
 * Run it under LD_BIND_NOW=1. Without it a lazily-bound slot still holds the
 * PLT resolver stub and the reading is of nothing. Eager binding changes WHEN
 * the choice is made, never WHICH definition is chosen.
 *
 * Exit 0 if every symbol is bound uniformly, 1 if any is mixed, 2 on a usage
 * or load error, so "mixed" is distinguishable from "could not measure".

/* Two relocation types carry the address the loader chose for a named symbol:

 * What they are NUMBERED is not, so they are a table here rather than two
 * constants inlined into the scan.
 *
 * ⚠ An unknown architecture must not fall through to an empty table. With no
 * type matching, the scan records nothing, every symbol prints "(no loaded
 * object references it)", and that reads as a finding about the driver stack
 * rather than as a probe that cannot run here. main() does catch the total
 * case and exits 2 with "nothing was measured", but a reader skimming the
 * per-symbol lines meets the wrong sentence first. Refuse at build time and
