/* gl-fwd.c: stand in for one bundled dispatcher whose plugin the host lacks.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE BUG. Vulkan survives a foreign-libc host because its
 * loader/driver boundary is thin and universal: the bundled libvulkan.so.1
 * dlopens the host's ICD, which exposes one entry point, and cross-libc-dlopen.so
 * carries that one object across the libc gap. OpenGL has no such boundary on
 * every host. The AppImage bundles libglvnd, whose libGL.so.1 is a DISPATCHER
 * that dlopens a VENDOR library (libGLX_mesa.so.0), and a host whose Mesa was
 * built without glvnd ships no vendor library at all. That is every musl distro
 * and every pre-glvnd glibc distro (Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 8). There the bundled
 * dispatcher has nothing to dispatch to, glXChooseVisual returns NULL, and the
 * application prints "couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual", a message
 * about visuals, for a fault that is about neither visuals nor libc.
 *
 * THE REPAIR. Replace the dispatcher rather than supply the missing plugin.
 * This object is built with the SONAME of the library it replaces, so ld.so
 * binds an application's DT_NEEDED to it and never loads the bundled one. Its
 * constructor picks a target and every entry point tail-jumps there:
 *
 *   - classic-Mesa host: the host's own libGL.so.1, loaded through
 *     cross-libc-dlopen.so, which strips version tags, drops the musl libc edge
 *     and bridges the remaining imports. RTLD_GLOBAL, because that is the
 *     shape a DT_NEEDED libGL has natively and classic Mesa's DRI driver
 *     relies on it (see glfwd_open_target).
 *   - glvnd host: the BUNDLED dispatcher, which works there. The shim becomes
 *     one extra jump and nothing else changes.
 *
 * WHY THE TABLE IS GENERATED. A shim that replaces a library must export
 * everything that library exports; anything less is `undefined symbol` for the
 * first application that links a name outside the list. The bundled libGL.so.1
 * exports 3470 entry points. So the list is READ OUT of the object being
 * replaced by tools/gen_gl_fwd.py, and `make gl-syms-check` fails the build if
 * the checked-in table drifts from it.
 *
 * WHY TRAMPOLINES AND NOT WRAPPERS. Each entry point is a tail jump through a
 * table slot, not a C function with a hand-written prototype. A tail jump
 * preserves every argument register, the return value and the varargs count in
 * %al, so it forwards ANY signature correctly, including the ones nobody
 * typed out. A hand-written prototype that disagrees with the real one corrupts
 * arguments silently, and with 3470 entry points that class of bug is not worth
 * carrying. The cost is that a trampoline forwards a CALL: exported data
 * objects cannot be forwarded, and the generator says so.
 *
 * Ahead of the jump each trampoline loads its own index into a scratch
 * register, which is what lets an UNRESOLVED slot reach code that knows which
 * entry point was called. See the block above glfwd_resolve_asm below; it is
 * the reason the host stack loads on first use rather than in a constructor,
 * and the reason an entry point the host cannot provide is a line rather than
 * a silent zero.
 *
 * THE SAME SOURCE FILE IS BUILT THREE TIMES, as gl-fwd.so, egl-fwd.so and
 * gles-fwd.so, differing only in the generated table and the vendor marker
 * its dispatcher looks for. See src/Makefile.

 * glfwd_resolve_asm is the other thing a slot can hold, and it is why a slot

 *
 * The problem it solves. A table slot is an address; whoever jumps through it
 * arrives with no idea WHICH slot they came from, so the old design had to
 * decide every entry point's fate in a constructor, either a real address or a
 * silent zero-returning stub, before the application had asked for anything.
 * That forced two things this file used to carry as defects: the host GL stack
 * was loaded in every process whether or not it would ever be used, and an
 * entry point the host does not implement was indistinguishable, from outside,
 * from one that worked and returned zero.
 *
 * The repair is the index. Each trampoline knows its own index at ASSEMBLY
 * time, so it loads it into a register the ABI already allows a call to
 * destroy: %r11 on x86-64, the register the PLT itself clobbers; x17/IP1 on
 * aarch64, which is reserved for exactly this class of veneer. It then
 * jumps through the slot as before. A resolved slot ignores it. An unresolved
 * slot points here, and here the index is the whole message.
 *
 * What this costs the fast path is one immediate load per call, on a path that
 * is about to enter a graphics driver. What it buys is B1 and B4.
 *
 * This is _dl_runtime_resolve minus the bookkeeping: save everything an
 * argument can arrive in, call a C function, put it all back, tail-jump to
 * whatever it decided. The saved set is the SysV argument registers plus %rax
 * (the varargs float count) and %r10 (the static chain, which glibc's own

 *      outside by @Samueru-sama: classic libGL.so.1 lives in
 *      <triplet>/mesa on Ubuntu's alternatives layout and classic libEGL.so.1
 *      in <triplet>/mesa-egl, the hardcoded list below had the first and not

 *      somebody else's packaging is FOR: it drifts, silently, and only on the
 *      hosts nobody has. The host writes the answer down in
 *      /etc/ld.so.conf.d/x86_64-linux-gnu_EGL.conf; reading it is the fix.
 *   3. the conventional directories, below. Still needed, and not a fallback
 *      in name only: musl distros have no /etc/ld.so.conf at all, and Alpine
 *      uses /etc/ld-musl-<arch>.path, so on the very host class this shim
 *      exists for, list 3 is the only one of the three that answers.
 *
 * PR #4's mesa-egl entries are kept in list 3 for the same reason: a host with
