# Infrastructure

Build, CI and orchestration.

## T-10 Prove every CI gate can fail

- **Source.** The port brief, review pass 2.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** high, **Effort** low,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** ⭐ **A gate never seen to refuse is a gate nobody knows works.**
  The workflows in [`../../.github/workflows/`](../../.github/workflows/) were written
  and reasoned about; only some of them have been watched to go red.
- **Premise.** Measured locally for three of them: a stale generated table, a
  wrong SONAME and a CR in a `.sh` each make the corresponding check exit
  non-zero. **Not measured on a runner**, and not measured at all for the
  old-name sweep, the endings check or the artefact verifier's floor rule.
- **Approach.** Plant each defect on a branch, push, read the run's conclusion.
  One defect per push, so the red is attributable.
- **Prove.** Six deliberately broken branches, each with the run URL and the
  step that refused, recorded here.

### What has been seen to refuse, and where

⭐ **Four of these were not planted.** They are gates that went red on a runner
against a real defect somebody committed, which is stronger evidence than a
plant: nobody chose the shape of the failure.

| gate | on a runner | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| every headline number has one home | ⭐ yes, unplanted | run [32948974925](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32948974925), hygiene, step `every headline number has exactly one home`: `46/46 appears in 2 files: docs/todo/PROGRESS.md docs/report/README.md`. The commit was a `PROGRESS.md` rewrite whose sentence warning that the number lives in two places contained the number |
| the evidence table refuses a broken stage | ⭐ yes, unplanted | run [32947794151](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32947794151), `evidence table (aarch64)`: `cp: cannot stat '/lib64/libc.so.6'`, `suite: stage 2 failed`, exit 1. That is pull request #9 against `main`, where the loader path is still hardcoded |
| the AppImage suite's sha256 verification | ⭐ yes, unplanted | run [32948154287](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32948154287): the upstream asset had been replaced and the suite refused rather than measuring an unknown binary |
| the AppImage suite's AppDir shape | ⭐ yes, unplanted | run [32951892766](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32951892766): `cp: cannot stat 'AppDir/lib/foreign-dlopen.so'`, on both architectures, after upstream renamed the dispatcher slot |
| the old repository name, two spellings | locally | `sh scripts/verify-gates.sh`, planted and clean, exit codes read unpiped |
| no tool is credited, two spellings | locally | the same |
| shell scripts parse | locally | the same |
| no CR in a shell script | locally | the same |
| ⭐ the dash ratchet | locally | the same. Added this session, and it is the reason the count is 8 rather than 7 |
| the drift check's six sections | locally | each planted separately: a stale citation behind a command, a tracked `.AppImage`, a tracked ELF under an innocent name, a dash added and a dash removed, the two orchestrators verifying different upstreams, and an `INDEX.md` row disagreeing with its entry |

### ⛔ What is still not proven, and why

- **The endings gate.** `.gitattributes` normalises a CRLF file on the way into
  the index, so the defect cannot be planted from the working tree at all.
  `verify-gates.sh` reports it as unproven rather than as passing.
- **The `generated` job**, both steps: a stale `forward-shim.c` and a version
  trap that no longer covers this libc. Measured locally before the port; not
  measured on a runner.
- **The artefact verifier's floor rule** and the build matrix.

⚠ Those four need a runner and a deliberate push, which is what the approach
above describes and what remains of this entry. The four unplanted rows do not
substitute for them: they prove four different gates.

---

## T-11 A machine-readable suite result

- **Source.** The port brief, task 5.0 obstacle 8.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** medium,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** Both suites report a human summary. Exit status is already
  correct, non-zero on any MISMATCH, so CI works today, but a failure is a
  log to scroll rather than an annotated line on the pull request.
- **Premise.** Measured: `grep -c MISMATCH` over a run's output agrees with the
  printed count.
- **Approach.** JUnit XML or JSON emitted **alongside** the human summary, not
  instead of it. ⛔ The `run`/`verdict` helpers in `experiments/*.sh` are where
  the data is, and those files are the tests: add an optional writer, do not
  restructure the reporting.
- **Prove.** A failing case appears as an annotation on the pull request.

---

## T-12 Measure the stage timeouts on a runner before trusting them

- **Source.** The port brief, task 5.0 obstacle 7.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** low,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** `timeout 90` (vkcube), `timeout -k 2 30` (GL cases), `timeout 25`
  (hardware glxgears) and `timeout -k 2 35` (gtk4) are wall-clock values tuned on
  one developer machine. ⚠ **A timeout is scored as a FAILURE, not a skip**, so a
  slow shared runner turns into a red build that looks like a regression.
- **Premise.** Measured on the developer machine only.
- **Approach.** Record the actual wall time of each timed case on
  `ubuntu-latest` and on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`. ⛔ **Raise rather than shorten.**
  Shortening hides the problem and makes the failure mode less legible.
- **Prove.** A table of measured-vs-configured per case, in this entry.

### Measured, both runners, run [32955888055](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32955888055)

⭐ The instrumentation had been in `run()` since this entry was opened and
nothing read it back, because no run of the AppImage suite had ever reached the
end. The stage reports it now. Worst observed wall time per case, across all
four host stages:

| case | configured | x86-64 | aarch64 | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E61 `glxgears` | `timeout -k 2 30` | 30 | 30 | ⚠ runs to its timeout |
| E62 `glxgears`, feature on | `timeout -k 2 30` | 30 | 30 | ⚠ runs to its timeout |
| E59 boundary scan | none | 11 | 1 | |
| everything else recorded | 25 to 90 | 0 to 1 | 0 to 1 | |

⛔ **E61 and E62 are not close to their timeout. They ARE their timeout, and
that is by construction.** A GL binary never exits on its own, so `timeout` is
how those cases end, and their wall time is the configured value by definition.
`experiments/40-appimage.sh` says so where it wraps them. ⚠ **Do not read 30
against 30 as no margin**, and do not raise it on that reading: E62 produced
`GL_RENDERER = llvmpipe` inside the window, so the work finished and only the
process did not.

⭐ **Every case that terminates on its own is far under.** The slowest is E59 at
11 seconds against a 25-second floor, and the rest are at or below 1 second on
both runners. The fear this entry was opened on, a slow shared runner turning a
pass into a red build, is not visible in this data.

### ⛔ What this measurement still cannot tell you

The timing report cannot distinguish "ran to its timeout because that is how
this case ends" from "was killed before it finished". Both appear as a wall
time equal to the configured value. For E61 and E62 the distinction is settled
by their output, which carried the answer; for a case that produced nothing it
would not be. ⚠ That is why the entry stays open: the margin question is
answered for the self-terminating cases and unanswerable, as instrumented, for
the two that are killed on purpose.

## T-13 A build error hidden by `2>/dev/null` cost a debugging cycle

- **Source.** Found during the port: adding an include to `src/gl-fwd.c` broke
  the `tgt-fwd.so` build in `experiments/30-run-tests.sh`, and the compiler's
  message was discarded. Ten cases reported `./tramp2: No such file or
  directory`, which names the wrong thing entirely.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** low,
  **Status** ⭐ **DONE**
- **Problem.** Several helper builds in the stages redirect stderr to
  `/dev/null`. When one fails the suite reports a cascade of downstream
  mismatches with no cause in the output.
- **Premise.** Measured: this happened, and reproducing the compile by hand was
  the only way to see the error.
- **Approach.** ⛔ `experiments/*.sh` are the tests and their assertions must not
  change. Capturing the build's stderr to a file and printing it only on failure
  changes no assertion. That is the shape.
- **Prove.** Break a helper build deliberately; the suite output names the
  compiler error rather than only its consequences.

### Closure

⚠ **It stopped being theoretical twice more before it was fixed.** Moving a
Python module out from under the shim generator broke it, and the suite
reported `gcc: error: gen-shim.c: No such file or directory` from E15 and
`./shimtest: No such file or directory` from E16. Neither named a cause,
because the generator's own message went to `/dev/null`.

Nine helper builds and the generator now capture stderr to `$BERR` and print it
only on failure, through a `bfail` helper. A passing run is exactly as quiet as
before, and no assertion changed: the capture happens at build time and the
cases still score themselves afterwards.

⭐ **The harness got the same shape first**, and that is what made the rest
findable. `run` now prints the WHOLE captured output of a MISMATCH rather than
its first line. E16 had been reporting `ok strlcpy short`, which is a step that
had succeeded; the real failure was `FAIL stat matches __xstat`, forty checks
later.

**Proven, by planting the defect.** A syntax error was added to
`tests/shim-selftest.c` and the suite run:

```
  E15    MATCH predicted=OK    compiled
  BUILD FAILED: shimtest
           | /repo/tests/shim-selftest.c:135:40: error: unknown type name 'this'
           |   135 | static void t13_planted_defect(void) { this is not C; }
  E16    MISMATCH predicted=OK    ./shimtest: No such file or directory
 predictions matched: 48   mismatched: 1
```

⭐ The compiler error is named, above the case it used to only look like.
Against a clean tree the same run reports 49 matched, 0 mismatched, and prints
no `BUILD FAILED` line at all, so the helper is not merely always shouting.

---

## T-14 Four files that no runner runs

- **Source.** The port brief, task 0.1.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** low, **Effort** low,
  **Status** ⭐ **DONE**
- **Problem.** ⭐ A test no runner runs is a test that has already stopped
  working and nobody has noticed.
- **Premise.** Measured, by grep over the tree.
  - `tests/allocprobe.c`: now compiled and smoke-run by the `orphans` job.
  - `tests/icd-harness.c`: built by `42-build-floor.sh` and invoked by nothing.
    Now compiled and smoke-run by the same job, against a real lavapipe ICD.
    ⚠ **Compiling is not running it against an ICD**, and the `orphans` job
    now fails rather than passing when no ICD is present.
  - `tools/libc_inventory.py`: what produced `inventories/*.json`. Not run by
    anything. It is a regeneration tool, not a test.
  - `tools/manual/trap_users.py`: not run by anything.
- **Approach.** Give `icd-harness` a real case in the AppImage suite, or move it
  beside the probe it duplicates. Move the two Python tools to `tools/manual/`
  with one line each saying what they are for.
- ⛔ Do not delete any of them on "nothing runs it" alone: three of the four are
  cited in documents, and deleting the file without the citation leaves a
  document pointing at nothing.
- **Prove.** `git grep -l` for each name resolves to either a CI job or a
  `tools/manual/README.md` line.

### ⛔ Correction: the premise above is wrong about `libc_inventory.py`

The premise says it is "not run by anything". ⛔ **It is run on every push.**
`tools/gen_forward_shim.py:37` does `from libc_inventory import version_key`,
and `make shim` runs that generator, and the `generated artefacts are not
stale` job runs `make shim` and diffs the result.

⚠ **The premise says "Measured, by grep over the tree", and the grep was
real.** It searched for the FILENAME, and an import names the module. That is
the whole error, and it is worth writing down because the same grep would miss
the same thing again.

⭐ It was caught by moving the file and running the suite: E15 went MISMATCH
with `gcc: error: gen-shim.c: No such file or directory`, and E16 followed with
`./shimtest: No such file or directory`. ⚠ **The generator's own error was
invisible**, because the E15 line ends in `2>/dev/null`. What made it findable
was T-13's shape being applied to the harness first: the `run` helper now
prints a MISMATCH's whole output, so E16's message named E15 as the cause
rather than only its own symptom.

`trap_users.py` was wrong in a second way. Its two `sys.path.insert` lines both
inserted its own directory, which was harmless while every tool sat together
and became an `ImportError` for `elfsym` and `version_traps` the moment it did
not.

### Closure

- `tests/allocprobe.c` and `tests/icd-harness.c` were already covered by the
  `orphans` job, against a real lavapipe ICD.
- `tools/libc_inventory.py` **stays in `tools/`**. It is a library the shim
  generator imports, not a manual tool.
- `tools/manual/trap_users.py` moved, with its `sys.path` corrected to reach
  `tools/`, and [`../../tools/manual/README.md`](../../tools/manual/README.md) says
  what it is for and who cites it.

⭐ **Both halves measured, by running them rather than by grepping for them:**

```
$ python3 tools/gen_forward_shim.py --floor ... --target ... --musl ... --quiet
  OK: generated 2388 lines
$ python3 tools/manual/trap_users.py /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6
libc /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: 21 trap(s), 10 benign re-versioning(s)
$ python3 tools/libc_inventory.py scan /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --name smoke
{ "counts": { "ld-linux-x86-64.so.2": 33, ...
```

`sh scripts/check-drift.sh` now checks both classes: every path a document
cites exists, and every module a tool imports is reachable from that tool's own
`sys.path`. The second check exists because of this entry.

## T-15 A corpus test with a fresh process per library

- **Source.** Reference sweep of `pg83/solo`, at
  [`docs/history/references/solo-usable.md`](../history/references/solo-usable.md) section 3.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** medium,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** `tests/corpus.c` loads every library in the host's library
  directory in **one** process and counts successes. Three weaknesses, all of
  which solo's design avoids:
  - one library that corrupts the process changes the verdict on every library
    after it;
  - a lazy load reports success for an object whose relocations would have
    failed at the first call;
  - the output is a count, not a per-symbol view of which ABI entries the
    corpus demands.
- **Premise.** ⭐ **No longer inferred. Observed here, on two hosts, in run
  [32957101324](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32957101324).**
  The first weakness above does not merely change the verdict on the libraries
  after the corrupting one: it truncates the result to **nothing**, and E33 and
  E34 are then scored against a total of zero.

  | host | feature ON | feature OFF |
  |---|---|---|
  | `alpine:3.22` | ⛔ `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`, 0 verdict lines | `TOTAL=298 OK=3` |
  | `debian:trixie-slim` | `FATAL: HWAddressSanitizer requires a kernel with tagged address ABI.`, 0 verdict lines | 99 OK lines, then the same FATAL |

  ⚠ **Both causes were invisible until this session**, because the sweep's
  stderr went to `/dev/null`. That is T-13's shape, and it is why the two
  entries are related: the crash had presumably been happening for as long as
  the corpus cases have existed, and the AppImage suite had never completed to
  show it.

  ⛔ The two causes are different in kind and the design above covers both. The
  Alpine one is a crash somewhere in a 298-library sweep and is not yet
  attributed to a library. The Debian one is a library that calls the process
  dead on load, which no fault handler catches and only a fresh process per
  library survives.

  The original reading of `tst/corpus.py` and `tst/corpus_load.cpp` stands, and
  ⚠ solo's corpus was still **not** run.
- **Approach.** One fresh process per library, `RTLD_NOW`, a fault handler
  installed before the load so a crash is a report rather than a silence, and
  per-library JSON merged afterwards.
- **Prove.** A deliberately corrupting library in the corpus changes exactly one
  row of the result instead of truncating it.

---

## T-16 Delete the path that would mask the failure

- **Source.** Reference sweep of `pg83/solo`, at
  [`docs/history/references/solo-usable.md`](../history/references/solo-usable.md) section 4.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** low,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** Several cases here *force* a path (`VK_DRIVER_FILES`,
  `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE`, `CROSS_LIBC_DLOPEN_GL_TARGET`), but none of them
  removes the alternative that would have worked anyway. A case that forces the
  path under test and leaves the fallback in place cannot distinguish "the
  forced path worked" from "the fallback did".
- **Premise.** Measured by reading `experiments/40-appimage.sh`; solo's
  `nixos-lavapipe` job does the opposite and is quoted in `solo-usable.md` section 4.
- **Approach.** ⛔ `experiments/*.sh` are the tests. Removing a masking path
  **changes what a case measures**, which is exactly the kind of edit that must
  not be made casually, so this is authored per case, with the before and after
  both recorded, not applied as a sweep.
- ⭐ Second, cheaper half: `glprobe` reads one pixel back. Asserting the whole
  frame by hash, with the environment stripped, is strictly stronger and costs
  nothing.
- **Prove.** For each case changed: the case still MATCHes, and the case with
  the forced path *removed* now MISMATCHes where it previously passed.

---

## T-17 The IBT property note is documented and is not there

- **Source.** Review pass 2 of the port: `scripts/verify-artifacts.sh` refused
  a build over it, and the refusal turned out to be right.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** medium, **Effort** medium,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** [`../report/09-the-second-boundary.md`](../report/09-the-second-boundary.md) 9 said the shims are built
  `-fcf-protection=full` "so the object carries the matching IBT property note".
  ⛔ **They do not.** The shipped `gl-fwd.so` has only `.note.gnu.build-id`;
  there is no `.note.gnu.property` section at all.
- **Premise.** Measured, three ways, so it is not a property of this source:

  | image | gcc | with the flag | with `-Wl,-z,ibt,-z,shstk` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `debian:bullseye-slim` | 10.2.1 | no note | no note |
  | `debian:bookworm-slim` | 12.2.0 | no note | no note |
  | `debian:trixie-slim` | 14.2.0 | no note | no note |

  A one-function shared object with no project code in it behaves identically,
  which is what rules the source out.

  ⚠ The `endbr64` instructions **are** emitted. What is missing is the note
  that tells the loader the object is IBT-capable, and without it a
  CET-enforcing host turns indirect-branch tracking off for the whole process.
  That is a mitigation lost in silence, which is the failure mode this
  repository spends the most words warning about.
- **Approach.** Find a floor toolchain whose gcc is configured with
  `--enable-cet`, or emit the note directly from `src/gl-fwd.c` as an assembler
  `.section .note.gnu.property` block, which is the option that does not move
  the glibc floor. ⭐ The second is likely the right answer, because raising the
  floor to get a note would trade a real portability guarantee for a mitigation.
- **Prove.**
  ```bash
  sh scripts/build.sh && readelf -n build/x86_64/gl-fwd.so | grep -i propert
  ```
  Closes when that prints an `x86 feature: IBT` line and the glibc floor in the
  build manifest has not moved.

---

## T-18 There is no release

- **Source.** The operator, at the end of the port session.
- **Category** infrastructure, **Priority** high, **Effort** medium,
  **Status** open
- **Problem.** `scripts/build.sh` produces verified artefacts and a manifest,
  and nothing publishes them. A consumer who wants `gl-fwd.so` has to build it,
  which means having a container engine and this repository.
- **Premise.** Measured: the build works on the floor for x86-64 and the
  verifier refuses a build that violates it. ⚠ **The aarch64 half has never been
  built anywhere**, not locally and not in CI, so "cross-compiles for aarch64"
  is a property of the script's code and not of any artefact.
- **Approach.** Build both architectures on the floor in CI, run the suites
  against them, and publish on success. ⛔ Every artefact ships three ways:
  loose, `.tar`, `.zip`, with **no nested directory** inside the archives, so
  an extract drops the files where the user is standing. The release body is
  generated: a changelog, the checksums, the floor and the maximum `GLIBC_*`
  each artefact ended up with.
- ⛔ **Nothing publishes on a red suite**, and nothing publishes from a branch
  that has not been through a pull request.
- **Prove.** A release exists whose assets' checksums match
  `build-manifest.json` for both architectures, and whose body was not written
  by hand.
