# PROGRESS

⭐ **Read this first, every session.** It is the only file that carries a work
order. [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) carries the list; this carries the order and the
baseline.

⚠ **Rewritten every session. It carries no history.** That is
[`../history/`](../history/README.md)'s job.

## Where the work is right now

⭐ **[`v0.1.0` is published.](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/releases/tag/v0.1.0)**
22 assets: both architectures, both variants, the loose objects for the default
one, and a `.tar`, `.zip` and `.sha256` for each. Tagged on `21e9236`, built on
the glibc 2.31 floor, body generated from the manifests by
`scripts/release-notes.sh`. Nothing in it was typed at release time.

⚠ **The old `main` had failing gates AND a failing secret sweep.** Both are
green now, so this is also the first time the default branch has been green.

**The tracker is empty and there is one branch.** Pull requests #8 and #10
merged; #1, #2 and #6 were auto-closed by Renovate when their bumps landed in
#8; #3, #4 and #5 were closed as superseded, verified against the pins on
`main`; #9 was closed because its diff no longer applies, with the reason and
the open policy question written into it. Issue #7 is answered and closed.
`main` is the only branch.

| workflow | latest |
|---|---|
| `gates` | ✅ on `main` |
| `secret-sweep` | ✅ on `main` |
| `release` | ✅ on `v0.1.0`, published |
| `appimage-suite` | ⛔ red on `main`, run [32959228414](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/cross-libc-dlopen/actions/runs/32959228414) |

⛔ **The nine cases that MISMATCH on `main`**, both architectures, so the next
session starts from a list rather than a re-run:

| case | what is known |
|---|---|
| E30, E37a | the control arm stopped contrasting. Item 1 |
| E33, E34 | the corpus sweep dies partway. Item 2 |
| E59, E62, E64, E66, E77 | ⚠ **not yet diagnosed.** E64 and E66 exit 139, a segmentation fault, on the aarch64 musl host. Whether they share a cause with E33 and E34 is unknown and worth asking first |

| suite | command | state |
|---|---|---|
| evidence table, x86-64 | `sh scripts/run-evidence.sh` | exit 0, every prediction held |
| evidence table, aarch64 | the same, on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | exit 0, three cases SKIP by name |
| AppImage suite | `sh scripts/run-appimage.sh` | ⚠ **completes on both architectures for the first time.** Mismatches remain and they are findings, below |
| build, all four | `sh scripts/build.sh --arch both` and again `--portable` | exit 0 |
| the gates, planted | `sh scripts/verify-gates.sh` | 8 proven, 0 not |
| the documents | `sh scripts/check-drift.sh` | exit 0, six sections |

⛔ **Totals live in [`../report/README.md`](../report/README.md)**, not here. Do not
copy one into this file: both are on the one-home list and a second copy turns
the gate red, which is exactly how commit `f6d126e` broke the branch.

## ⛔ The work order

### 1. The A/B's control arm no longer contrasts. This needs a decision

⭐ **Start here. It is the only item that changes what the project claims.**

Upstream adopted this project. The demo AppImage's `lib/foreign-dlopen.so` is
gone, `lib/cross-libc-dlopen.so` is in its place, and it is a build of this
project. So the "as shipped" arm of the A/B is no longer upstream's naive shim.

E30 and E37a are the controls for that arm, and they are what make the patched
arm a measurement rather than a coincidence. Both now MISMATCH, because both
arms work. `docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md` 9.17 has the output.

⚠ **Their log lines say `predicted=OK` and that is about the exit status, not
the verdict.** What they assert is the needle, and the needle is the complaint:
`NO-DEVICES` for E30 and `zero accessible devices` for E37a. A MISMATCH there
means the as-shipped arm found a device.

⛔ **Do not flip the predictions.** A control that has stopped contrasting has
stopped measuring, and rewriting it to expect success converts two controls
into two cases that pass whatever the shim does.

⚠ The honest control for "the feature is absent" is an AppDir with **no**
dispatcher in `.preload`, not one carrying somebody else's. Adopting that
changes what the suite claims about upstream, which is why it was left for a
decision rather than taken.

### 2. The corpus sweep dies partway, and E33/E34 are scored against nothing

⛔ **New, and it had been invisible.** `tests/corpus.c` loads every library in
the host's directory in ONE process. On two hosts that process dies partway and
produces no verdict line at all, so the total is 0 and both cases are scored
against nothing:

| host | feature ON | feature OFF |
|---|---|---|
| `alpine:3.22` | `Segmentation fault (core dumped)` | `TOTAL=298 OK=3` |
| `debian:trixie-slim` | `FATAL: HWAddressSanitizer requires a kernel with tagged address ABI.` | 99 OK lines, then the same |

Both causes went to `/dev/null` until this session. ⭐ This is **T-15's**
premise, which was inferred from reading another project and is now observed
here. Its fresh-process-per-library design covers both. ⚠ The Alpine
segmentation fault is **not yet attributed to a library**, and until it is,
nobody should assume it is the corpus's fault rather than this project's.

⭐ **E49 and E50 are done.** E49 MATCHes on aarch64, and E50 reports 2 live
hazards on x86-64 and 3 on aarch64, the third being the mutex. E50 reads the
condition out of `abi-host`'s size table instead of carrying a per-architecture
number. `docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md` 9.18.

### 3. The demo tag is rolling. The suite verifies against the release API

The upstream publishes one release and its tag is `demo`, and the assets were
replaced twice inside two minutes. ⛔ There is no immutable release to pin to.
The suite therefore carries no checked-in digest: it reads the digest the
release API publishes at download time and verifies the bytes against it,
refusing on a mismatch. `docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md` 9.15 has the
policy and the reasoning.

When the download does not verify, the two candidates are a torn read from a
re-upload in progress and a genuinely wrong download. The suite re-reads the
release once before refusing, so the first is not blamed on the network.

⚠ All three assets come from `pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-AppImages`, the upstream:
the demo AppImage, `gtk4-demo`, and the `host-drivers` builds. The upstream now
publishes the host-drivers assets too, so nothing depends on a fork.

### 4. T-12 is answered for one half and unanswerable for the other

The table is in T-12's entry, both runners. ⭐ Every case that ends on its own
is far under its timeout: the slowest is 11 seconds against a 25-second floor
and the rest are at or below one second. The fear the entry was opened on is
not in the data.

⚠ **E61 and E62 measure 30 against a configured 30, and that is not a margin
of zero.** A GL binary never exits on its own, so the timeout is how those two
END. ⛔ Do not raise them on that reading. What stays open is that the
instrumentation cannot tell "ran to its timeout on purpose" from "was killed
before finishing", because both look identical.

### 5. T-10, T-11, T-16

T-10's entry now carries which gates have been seen to refuse and where, and
⭐ four of them were not planted: they went red on a runner against a real
defect, which is stronger than a plant because nobody chose the shape of the
failure. ⛔ Four are still unproven and the entry names them: the endings gate,
which `.gitattributes` makes unplantable from the working tree; the two
`generated` steps; and the artefact verifier's floor rule. Those need a runner
and a deliberate push.

⛔ **One guard remains unproven**, `release.yml`'s ancestor refusal. Item 6 has
why the release going green did not test it. `package-release.sh`'s two were
planted this session and both refuse.

T-11 and T-16's cheaper half were not started. T-16's is a `glprobe` change,
and it can only be verified by a GL-capable suite run.

### 6. The release is cut. What it did NOT prove

⭐ **`v0.1.0` is published**, on `21e9236`, 22 assets, both architectures and
both variants. The `release` workflow went green end to end on the tag: the
evidence table on both runners, the floor-checked build, the packaging, the
generated body, and the publish.

⚠ **A first release is not proof that the release path is right**, only that it
ran. Two things in it are still unproven:

- ⛔ **`release.yml`'s ancestor refusal.** It rejects a tag whose commit never
  reached the default branch. `v0.1.0`'s commit did, so the check passed
  without being tested. Firing it needs a tag on a commit that is NOT an
  ancestor of `main`, and if the guard fails, that publishes. It is the one
  guard in this family nobody has seen refuse.
- **The floor rule at publish time** fired on nothing, because no artefact
  exceeded the floor. `package-release.sh`'s other two refusals were planted
  and both work.

⚠ There is no second release to diff against, so `release-notes.sh`'s changelog
range took its "First release" branch. The `prev..TAG` branch is untested.

## What this session did

Every claim below has its measurement in `docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md` 9.14 through 9.18.

**Three deep review passes**, each with a different question.

*Pass 1, can every guard added here refuse?* The dash ratchet was recorded as
having failed to fire. It had not: the refusal condition was `count > pin`,
nothing ever lowered the pin, and the tree had drifted eight under, so the
planted dash landed inside the slack. The pin is exact now and a fall refuses
too. It also counted the `--` that the prose rule exempts inside a code block,
which made the section recording the fix unwritable. The cited-path check
could not see a path cited in front of a command, and so never noticed that
`conventions/prose.md` named a ratchet script that has never existed.

*Pass 2, what did this branch stop measuring?* The ARM runner was added saying
qemu "emulates the instructions and not a memory model", and section P went on
running the aarch64 trampolines under qemu **on aarch64 silicon**. It picks its
vehicle from the host now and prints it. The marker was removed and four
documents went on calling it load-bearing.

*Pass 3, does every claim hold when the command is run?* T-13's
"print a MISMATCH in full" was in one harness and not the other, and it was
found by the failure it describes. The corpus cases were the same shape a
third time, reporting a zero total with the reason in a discarded stderr.
`INDEX.md` listed two entries as open that declare themselves DONE.

**Three new checks, each planted and seen to refuse.** The dash ratchet in
`verify-gates.sh`; the two orchestrators agreeing on the same upstream; every
`INDEX.md` row against its entry's declared status.

**The AppImage suite completes**, having never done so before. Getting there
meant re-pinning against a mutable tag, moving `gtk4-demo` to the true
upstream, and teaching the suite to read the dispatcher slot out of the AppDir
rather than spelling it.

⭐ **And completing it found a real limitation nothing else could have.** On
aarch64 a musl object cannot allocate and initialise its own `pthread_mutex_t`
in a glibc process: 40 bytes allocated, 48 written, no crossing involved. It
needed real ARM silicon, three chained reporting defects fixed before it was
even legible, and one wrong fix before the right one. `docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md` 9.18.

**`tests/bindprobe.c` builds on aarch64.**

**T-12 answered**, and **T-10's entry now says which gates have been seen to
refuse and where**, including four that were never planted because they went
red on a runner against a real defect.

---

## ⚠ What a new session should distrust

- **The `.preload` baseline is DERIVED, not shipped.** The AppImage ships this
  project's own forwarding shims in its `.preload`, and restoring that list
  would make every absence case measure a presence. `41-extract.sh` prints what
  it drops on every extraction. If that line disappears, look at it.
- **`ground-truth.md`'s inventory carries a verdict column now.** Two rows are
  UNVERIFIED and say why. Do not quietly re-attach them to the new binary.
- **The tracker is evidence, not instruction.** Pull request #9's premise, that
  `-fcf-protection=full` breaks aarch64, is true of `main` and already fixed on
  this branch; what remains of it is a policy question about the default.
- **A guard that has never been seen to refuse is a guard nobody knows works.**
  Three were found decorative or unarmed this session and every one of them
  looked fine.
