# Ground truth, measured

Every number here came from a command that was run. Nothing is estimated.
Reproduce with the commands shown; the tooling is in `tools/`.

## The evidence table still holds

```
.\experiments\run.ps1
```

**22/22 predictions held.** E1 to E13 unchanged, E14 to E21 added by this work.
Before any change it was 14/14, so nothing here regressed the baseline.

## The musl gap is exactly two symbols

```
python3 tools/gap.py --fetch
```

```
glibc exports : 4155
musl  exports : 1645
musl-only (absent from glibc entirely): 53
UNION OF GAP over whole musl closure: ['___environ', 'atexit']
```

`atexit` is STRONG, so fatal under `DF_BIND_NOW`. `___environ` is WEAK, so it
resolves to 0 and the bug is latent.

Note that this is the union over the **Mesa and LLVM closure**. Over the whole
Alpine `/usr/lib` one more musl-only symbol is load-bearing: `issetugid`, which
blocks `libX11.so.6` and `libdbus-1.so.3`. See [`report/05-design-b-generated-shim.md`](report/05-design-b-generated-shim.md) section 5.3.

## The demo AppImage, inventoried

`vkcube+glxgears-host-drivers-demo-x86_64.AppImage`, sha256
`712766f8a4dc6b5ea3193ed7bb0282b64c7b781f7334056416edd3d00e8960bd`,
10 736 056 bytes. Extracted with `--appimage-extract`; the embedded filesystem
is DwarFS, not squashfs.

⛔ **That hash is not what the suite runs any more.** The upstream release is a
mutable tag and the asset was replaced. The hash above is left as written
because it names the binary these answers were taken from, which is the only
thing that makes them checkable, and the **verdict** column below says what
each row is against the build the suite verified today.
[`report/09-the-second-boundary.md`](report/09-the-second-boundary.md) 9.15 has the verification policy and 9.17 has the
re-measurement, including why two rows are UNVERIFIED rather than corrected.

| Question | Answer | against the build verified today |
|---|---|---|
| **Bundled glibc version** | **2.44**, from `ld.so (GNU libc) stable release version 2.44` | unchanged |
| Legacy split libs bundled? | **Yes**: `libpthread.so.0`, `libdl.so.2`, `librt.so.1`, `libutil.so.1`, `libresolv.so.2`. `libanl.so.1` is **absent** | unchanged |
| Are they real libraries? | **No, they are post-2.34 stubs.** Measured export counts: libpthread **13**, libdl **4**, librt **6**, libutil **2** | ⚠ UNVERIFIED. No counting method reproduces these four on the new binary and the old one is gone, so method and artefact cannot be separated. The stub claim holds |
| `.preload` contents | `path-mapping.so`, `anylinux.so`, `cross-libc-dlopen.so`, in that order | ⛔ CHANGED. Three more entries, and they are this project's own forwarding shims |
| `.foreign-dlopen-enabled` | present, 0 bytes. It was the opt-in marker quick-sharun writes; this project no longer reads it, and the feature is on by default whenever the object is preloaded | unchanged |
| Bundled `cross-libc-dlopen.c` | **byte-identical** to upstream `main`, 24 785 bytes | ⛔ GONE. No such file ships now |
| Bundled libraries | 51 sonames, plus `gconv/`, `locale/` and `vkmark/` subdirectories | ⚠ the three subdirectories are unchanged; the soname total is UNVERIFIED for the same reason as the export counts |
| gconv bundled? | **Yes**, so the Dolphin issue #63 lesson has been applied | unchanged |
| the dispatcher slot `.preload` names | `lib/foreign-dlopen.so` | ⛔ CHANGED to `lib/cross-libc-dlopen.so` |

### Why the stub detail matters

Keeping the legacy split libraries loaded is what makes symbols re-homed by
glibc 2.34 still resolve after version stripping. On **this** AppImage that is
a no-op, because its glibc is 2.44 and those files are 4-to-13-symbol stubs.
The fix is still implemented, because it is load-bearing for any AppImage built
on a pre-2.34 glibc, but it is not what makes this artifact work and saying
otherwise would be wrong.

What **is** load-bearing here is the mirror image, which was not anticipated:
musl folds `libm` into `libc` while glibc splits it out. See [`report/03-defects-found-by-measurement.md`](report/03-defects-found-by-measurement.md)
section 3.1.

## The forward-compatibility surface for this AppImage is empty

```
python3 tools/libc_inventory.py scan <appdir>/lib --name appdir-bundled -o inventories/appdir.json
python3 tools/libc_inventory.py matrix <distro-runtimes>/
```

Bundled is glibc **2.44**, 4 287 dynamic symbols across the runtime set.

| Host | Release | Symbols the host has and the bundle lacks | Branch taken |
|---|---|---|---|
| debian bullseye | 2.31 | 35 | bundled, host older |
| ubuntu 20.04 | 2.31 | 35 | bundled, host older |
| rocky 9 | 2.35 | 10 | bundled, host older |
| debian trixie | 2.41 | 4 | bundled, host older |
| fedora 44 | 2.43 | 1 | bundled, host older |
| opensuse tumbleweed | 2.43 | 1 | bundled, host older |
| arch | 2.44 | 1 | bundled, host equal |
| alpine 3.22 | musl 1.2.5 | n/a | bundled plus shim, no host glibc |

The single host-only symbol on the newest hosts is
`__libanl_version_placeholder`, an empty ABI placeholder from `libanl.so.1`,
which this AppDir does not bundle. It is not reachable from a driver.

**This AppImage has no enumerable forward-compatibility gap today, because it
bundles the newest released glibc.** Running the generator against its own floor
produces a shim whose entire version-gap contribution is zero, with only the
musl bridge left:

```
floor  : appdir-bundled glibc 2.44 (4287 symbols)
target : glibc-2.44 (4288 symbols)
gap    : 3 symbols the floor lacks
   implementable     2      <- atexit, at_quick_exit
   stub-only         0
   irrelevant        1      <- __libanl_version_placeholder
```

This reframes the priority order:

- Case 1 is already solved for this artifact by bundling a new-enough glibc.
  No shim, no runtime switch, nothing to do.
- It is **not** solved in general. Any AppImage built on an older distro has the
  gap, and this one acquires it the day glibc 2.45 ships.
- So the generator is parameterised by the floor and regenerated when the
  bundled glibc changes, and it is demonstrated against a realistic older floor
  of 2.31, where the gap is 628 symbols.

## Collision surface

Sonames present in **both** the AppDir and the Alpine 3.22 Mesa and LLVM
closure:

| soname | AppDir | Alpine host |
|---|---|---|
| `libGL.so.1` | `libGL.so.1.7.0`, GLVND | `mesa-gl` |
| `libgcc_s.so.1` | bundled | `libgcc 14.2.0` |
| `libstdc++.so.6` | `libstdc++.so.6.0.36` | `libstdc++ 14.2.0`, so `.6.0.33` |

**Three sonames.** These are exactly what the "bundled wins" invariant must
guard, and exactly where the pre-fix implementation was violating it. See
[`report/03-defects-found-by-measurement.md`](report/03-defects-found-by-measurement.md) section 3.2.

Host-only, so they must come from the host: `libLLVM.so.20.1`,
`libgallium-25.1.9.so`, `libvulkan_lvp.so`, `libc.musl-x86_64.so.1`.

## The distro matrix

Runtime sets copied out of eight real images and inventoried offline.

```
set                family  release    syms  missing
debian-bullseye    glibc   2.31       3697  -
ubuntu-2004        glibc   2.31       3697  -
rocky-9            glibc   2.35       3904  -
debian-trixie      glibc   2.41       4226  -
fedora-44          glibc   2.43       4286  -
opensuse-tw        glibc   2.43       4286  -
arch               glibc   2.44       4288  -
alpine-3.22        musl    1.2.5      1645  -
```

Rocky 9 is often cited as glibc 2.34; the current image measures **2.35**.
Fedora 44 and openSUSE Tumbleweed both measure 2.43, Arch 2.44, as expected.

**All eight provide a complete matched runtime set**, meaning every member of
`{ld.so, libc, libm, libdl, libpthread, librt, libutil, libanl, libresolv}` is
present from one directory. So the completeness check is never what blocks a
switch on a mainstream distro; the version comparison is.

### Selector decision on each host

Run with a fake AppDir bundling glibc 2.31, so the newer hosts are genuinely
newer. The real AppImage bundles 2.44 and picks `bundled` everywhere, which is
correct, and is why the probe is run both ways.

| Host | Host glibc | Decision | Reason given |
|---|---|---|---|
| debian bullseye | 2.31 | **bundled** | not newer than bundled |
| ubuntu 20.04 | 2.31 | **bundled** | not newer than bundled |
| rocky 9 | 2.35 | **host** | newer, set internally consistent |
| debian trixie | 2.41 | **host** | newer, set internally consistent |
| fedora 44 | 2.43 | **host** | newer, set internally consistent |
| opensuse tumbleweed | 2.43 | **host** | newer, set internally consistent |
| arch | 2.44 | **host** | newer, set internally consistent |
| alpine 3.22 | musl | **bundled** | no host glibc, bundled plus shim is the only option |

Every switch was verified empirically by the self-test before being committed
to.

## Library-path configuration, per distro

Input to the sharun patch.

| Distro | `/usr/local/lib` | `/usr/local/lib64` | `/usr/libexec` | `ld.so.conf` names | cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| alpine 3.22 | yes | no | no | none, musl | absent |
| debian bullseye | yes | no | yes | `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/local/lib/<triplet>`, `/lib/<triplet>`, `/usr/lib/<triplet>` | present |
| debian trixie | yes | no | yes | same as bullseye | present |
| ubuntu 20.04 | yes | no | no | same as bullseye | present |
| rocky 9 | yes | yes | yes | empty in the base image | present |
| fedora 44 | yes | yes | yes | empty in the base image | present |
| opensuse tumbleweed | yes | yes | yes | `/usr/local/lib64`, `/usr/local/lib` | present |
| arch | yes | no | no | empty in the base image | present |

`/usr/local/lib` exists on **all eight** and was absent from sharun's hardcoded
list. That is the concrete bug E13b demonstrates, and it is **fixed upstream**:
[pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-sharun@`54208d2`](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-sharun/commit/54208d2bc7d4c919ba46a6c234f6af7f8426b537) adds `/usr/local/lib`,
`/usr/local/lib32` and `/usr/local/lib64` to the hardcoded list and appends the
directories it scrapes out of `/etc/ld.so.cache`. The patch that used to live in
`patches/` here has been deleted rather than carried, because a hand-applied
patch against a moving upstream drifts from what the AppImage actually ships.

**What the cache reaches, measured rather than assumed.** "Read the real cache,
it is authoritative" is the natural reading of that change and it is not quite
right: `ldconfig` records a directory only if it held a library when the cache
was last built, so a present-but-empty directory is invisible to a cache scrape
even when `/etc/ld.so.conf` names it. Base images of five distros:

| host | `/etc/ld.so.cache` | dirs from the cache | dirs from `ld.so.conf` | named by conf, absent from the cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| alpine 3.22 | **absent** | 0 | no such file | none |
| debian trixie | present | 1 | 3 | `/usr/lib/<triplet>`, `/usr/local/lib` |
| ubuntu 24.04 | present | 1 | 3 | `/usr/lib/<triplet>`, `/usr/local/lib` |
| fedora 41 | present | 1 | 0 | none |
| arch | present | 1 | 0 | none |

A base image is the weakest case for the cache: everything lives in one
directory. This understates it on a real desktop, where the cache is what
names a Gentoo `/usr/lib/llvm/N/lib64` or a WSL `/usr/lib/wsl/lib`. The point is
narrower: the two mechanisms are **complementary**, and upstream covers the
`/usr/local/*` half by hardcoding it rather than by reading the cache.

Three things the deleted patch did that upstream does not, recorded so they are
not lost:

- `/etc/ld-musl-<arch>.path`, which is the musl equivalent of `ld.so.conf`.
  No musl host has an `ld.so.cache` at all, so the cache scrape is dead there.
  Narrower than it sounds: Alpine 3.22 ships no such file either, and musl's
  built-in default is `/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib`, all three of which
  upstream now has. It bites only a musl host that has been given an explicit
  path file.
- multiarch triplets past x86-64, i386 and aarch64 (riscv64, ppc64le, s390x,
  loongarch64), which the cache covers only where a cache exists.
- `/usr/libexec`, Guix's `/run/current-system/profile/lib`, Flatpak's
  `/app/lib` and Termux's prefix, none of which has a cache.
