# The blocker, and what it actually was

The defect that held the whole thing up, and the reason the first two
guesses about it were wrong.

*Moved verbatim from `CONTINUE.md` when that file was dissolved into the
work record. The wording is the original: a trap written down in one
sentence is a trap the next person does not walk into.*

### 4.1 The blocker, now fixed

`vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices` returned `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` with zero
devices. This was attributed to glibc-vs-musl ABI differences. **It was not
that.**

The measurement that broke it open was reproducing the failure on
`debian:trixie-slim` with **one libc**: Debian's own glibc-built
`libvulkan_lvp.so`, glibc 2.41 on both sides, no musl anywhere. Then the chain
fell out in an afternoon, because Debian ships Mesa's `__FILE__` strings and
`mesa-vulkan-drivers-dbgsym` exists:

```
lvp_device.c:1315            lvp_init_wsi() failed
wsi_display_init_wsi()       -> VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY
wsi_common_display.c:2323    u_cnd_monotonic_init() -> thrd_error
                             pthread_cond_init() -> 22 (EINVAL)
gdb, info symbol $pc         libc+0x909f0 = pthread_cond_init@GLIBC_2.2.5
                             (the working run: libc+0x91b00 = @@GLIBC_2.3.2)
```

`pthread_cond_init@GLIBC_2.2.5` is the pre-2003 compat definition and its whole
body is `if (cond_attr != NULL) return EINVAL;`.

**An unversioned reference does not get the default definition of a symbol.**
A version-stripped object has only unversioned references. So does every
musl-built object, which never had version information at all. That is why the
same failure showed up on Alpine, on Gentoo with a glibc `radv`, and on Debian
once the ICD manifest named an absolute path.

The fix is [`src/version-compat.c`](../../src/version-compat.c) plus
[`tools/version_traps.py`](../../tools/version_traps.py); ../report/06-goal-2-the-last-blocker.md 6.2 has the whole
chain with the commands.
