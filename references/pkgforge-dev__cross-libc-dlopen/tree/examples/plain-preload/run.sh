# A plain LD_PRELOAD against a normal binary. No AppDir, no marker file, no
# .preload, no launcher.
#
# ⭐ THIS IS THE STANDALONE CASE. Every measured result in docs/report/README.md was
# obtained through an AppImage, which is the hardest consumer because it
# supplies its own loader. This shows the easiest one: an ordinary dynamically
# linked program on an ordinary host.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. A glibc process opens a musl-built shared object.
#
#   before  dlopen fails, naming musl's libc, which is not on this host
#   after   the same dlopen succeeds and the symbol in it is called
#
# ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE. The object on the far end is a stand-in, not a
# host GPU driver. That is the difference between this and docs/todo/measurement.md
# T-03, and it is why the README's opening sentence is still about AppImages.
#
#   sh examples/plain-preload/run.sh
#
# Needs podman or docker. Nothing is installed on the host and nothing is
# written outside a temporary directory.
