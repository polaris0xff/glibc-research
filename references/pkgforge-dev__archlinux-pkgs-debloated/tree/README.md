# archlinux-pkgs-debloated

*Previously known as 'llvm-libs-debloated'*

---

This repo makes modified versiones of Archlinux packages, these are intended for AppImages to reduce final size, like:

* `mesa-mini` and `vulkan-{radeon,intel,etc}-mini` remove linking to `libLLVM.so`, making any hardware accelerated app tiny as result.

* `mesa-nano` and `vulkan-{radeon,intel,etc}-nano` similar to `mesa-mini`, built with -Os which makes it ~30% smaller. Note -Os can have a performance and even stability issue so do not use this package in apps like emulators where this is critical.

* `llvm-libs-mini` smaller version of `libLLVM.so` which is a 150+ MiB library, this version is reduced down to 99 MiB.

* `llvm-libs-nano`, similar to `mini`, but with the llvm targets limited (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) + `AMDGPU`, this reduces the size of the library to less than 70 MiB. Note this will cause issues if application depends on more llvm targets like compilers.

* `qt6-base-mini` and `libxml2-mini`, remove 30 MiB libicudata lib dependency.

* `ffmpeg-mini` which removes 20 MiB libx265.so dependency, also removes AV1 enconding support (decoding still works).

* `ffmpeg-nano` a much more stripped down ffmpeg that only decodes `mp3`, `opus`, `vorbis`, `png` and `jpeg` (no encoders, no hardware acceleration, no external codec libraries).

* `sdl2_image-mini` removes AVIF and JPEG-XL support from `SDL2_image`. AVIF pulls in `libavif` plus the whole AV1 codec family (`libaom`, `SvtAv1Enc`, `rav1e`, `dav1d`) and JPEG-XL pulls `libjxl` — ~23 MiB combined that most apps never use. PNG/JPG/TIFF/WEBP still work.

* `opus-mini` I have no idea why Archlinux makes this lib 5 MiB when both ubuntu and alpine make it <500 KiB

* `gdk-pixbuf2-mini`, `librsvg-mini` These remove the glycin dependency, ~20 MiB of bloat. (glycin is also super buggy and depends on `bwrap` which is problematic for running appimages in very old kernels).

* `glycin-mini` Builds [`glycin-ng`](https://github.com/QaidVoid/glycin-ng), alternative to glycin that does not have the many problems that GNOME glycin has.

* `icu-mini` Much smaller version of `libicudata.so` that is less than 3 MIB in size (10x reduction in size).

* `gtk2-mini` Builds `gtk2-ng-git`, a community-maintained fork of GTK2.

* `libdecor-mini` Builds [`libdecor-rs`](https://github.com/QaidVoid/libdecor-rs), rust implementation of libdecor without GTK/D-Bus dependencies (Ideal for SDL apps).
