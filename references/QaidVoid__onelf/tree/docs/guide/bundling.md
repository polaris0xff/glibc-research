# Bundling Libraries

`onelf bundle-libs` walks the ELF files in an AppDir, resolves their
dependencies, and copies the shared libraries into `lib/`.

## Basic usage

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp
```

With no flags, this:

1. Scans every ELF file under `./myapp/` for `DT_NEEDED` entries.
2. Resolves each soname via ldconfig (or the NixOS store, when detected).
3. Copies the resolved `.so` files into `./myapp/lib/`.
4. Rewrites `RPATH`/`RUNPATH` on every bundled ELF to
   `$ORIGIN/../lib:$ORIGIN/../../lib:$ORIGIN/../../../lib`, so the
   bundled binaries find their libs relative to their own location
   without needing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. For binaries without an existing
   slot, `bundle-libs` falls back to `patchelf --set-rpath` (when
   patchelf is in `PATH`) to add a fresh entry.
5. Injects an AT_EXECFN bootstrap into each bundled executable. At
   runtime, the bootstrap reads `AT_EXECFN`, computes the bundled
   interpreter path relative to the binary's own location, and jumps
   into it. This keeps `/proc/self/exe` pointing at the real binary,
   which is important for Python's stdlib detection, Electron's ASAR
   locator, and Qt's plugin loader.
6. Scrubs `/usr/`, `/etc/`, `/nix/`, `/lib/`, and `/lib64/` strings
   inside the bundled dynamic loader to `/XXX/`, so it won't pick up
   the host's `ld.so.preload`, `ld.so.cache`, or hardcoded fallback
   library dirs.

## Libraries that come from the host

A library the bundle does not provide is not a hard error at runtime. The
runtime appends the host's library directories to the search path so GPU
drivers stay reachable, and those directories hold the whole system's
libraries, not just drivers. So a missing soname is quietly satisfied by
the host's copy and loaded into a process that is already holding the
bundled libc. Two different glibcs then share one process, which is what
actually crashes.

The bundled loader's own fallbacks are already closed: its compiled-in
search directories and its `ld.so.cache` path are both blanked at bundle
time. The search path above is the deliberate exception.

That search path is the well-known library directories plus every further
directory the host's `ld.so.cache` names. onelf reads the cache itself
rather than letting the loader do it, so the loader stays sealed and the
decision about what the host may supply stays on onelf's side. Without
this the list is a guess about where a distribution puts things, and a
host GPU driver can load while its own dependencies cannot: Gentoo slots
LLVM under `/usr/lib/llvm/<n>/lib64`, so Mesa's RADV driver resolves, the
`libLLVM.so.<n>` behind it does not, and Vulkan goes silently missing.
Cache directories are appended last, so nothing they contain can displace
a bundled library or the driver closure that has to be searched first.

The symptom is "works on my machine", and that is not a joke about
testing: on the packer's machine the host copy *is* the matching one, so
the bundle genuinely works there and fails on a machine whose libraries
are older or newer.

So `bundle-libs` reports what it did not bundle:

```
warning: 1 librar(ies) are not in the bundle:
  - libm.so.6 (needed by myapp)
```

Whether that is fatal depends on the host library directories below. A
package that keeps them resolves these from the host; one that does not
fails where the library is first used.

Some entries are expected. GL, DRI, Vulkan and NSS libraries are meant to
come from the host, because they have to match the user's drivers and
system configuration. The warning lists them so you can tell the
deliberate ones from the accidental ones; nothing fails.

For the accidental ones, point `--search-path` at a directory holding the
library and repack. A library reached only through `dlopen` will not
appear in `DT_NEEDED` at all, so `--scan-dlopen` is what finds those.

### Withholding the host directories

A package that needs nothing from the host is better off without those
directories entirely, and by default it does not get them. `pack` decides
from the bundle's contents: if nothing references a GPU driver stack, the
host's directories are left off the search path.

The effect is that a missing library fails honestly:

```
error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.6: cannot open shared object file
```

rather than loading the host's copy next to your bundled libc and
crashing later, somewhere else, on a machine you do not have.

Override it when the guess is wrong:

```bash
onelf pack app -o app.onelf --command bin/app --host-libs always
```

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `auto` (default) | Expose them only if the bundle references a driver stack |
| `always` | Always expose them |
| `never` | Never expose them |

or as `host-libs` under `[package]` in a recipe.

Detection is deliberately generous, because a wrong "no" breaks an app
that works while a wrong "yes" only leaves the previous behaviour in
place. It matches driver sonames anywhere in the bundle's binaries, not
just in `DT_NEEDED`, since drivers are reached through `dlopen`. Reach for
`always` if your app loads a host library under a name it does not
mention, such as one built at runtime from parts.

## Self-extracting binaries (Bun, etc.)

Some binaries embed their payload at the end of the file. The most
common case is pre-1.3.12 Bun-compiled apps, which look for the
trailer `\n---- Bun! ----\n` at `-16` from end-of-file. These need
special handling. `bundle-libs` detects them automatically and:

- Skips bootstrap injection. The bootstrap appends bytes to the
  binary, which would clobber the trailer and break payload
  detection.
- Skips `patchelf --set-rpath` for binaries lacking a DT_RUNPATH
  slot. patchelf can grow the file.

At runtime, the onelf-rt arranges for the kernel to handle PT_INTERP
directly. In FUSE and tmpfs modes, it bind-mounts the bundled linker
over the binary's existing PT_INTERP path inside a private mount
namespace. In cache mode, it creates a short `/tmp` symlink and
patches the binary's PT_INTERP in-place. Either way,
`/proc/self/exe` resolves to the binary itself and Bun finds its
embedded JS bundle.

Bun 1.3.12 and newer uses a dedicated `.bun` ELF section instead of
the end-of-file trailer. Those binaries are unaffected by file-end
appending and get normal bootstrap injection treatment.

## Starting from a bare binary

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --from-binary /usr/bin/myapp
```

Copies `/usr/bin/myapp` into `./myapp/bin/myapp`, then runs the normal flow.

## Detecting dlopen'd libs

Some libraries are loaded at runtime via `dlopen` and don't appear in
`DT_NEEDED`. `--scan-dlopen` searches the binary strings for common
candidates (GL, Wayland, Vulkan, X11, audio, DBus, and so on) and bundles
any matches.

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --scan-dlopen
```

You can extend the allow-list with extra sonames:

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --scan-dlopen --dlopen libmyvendor.so.1
```

## Framework auto-detection

If the binary has `DT_NEEDED` for `libGL.so.1`, onelf automatically enables
GL/DRI bundling. Same for Qt/GTK/Vulkan/Wayland. Detection also scans the
binary's byte content for literal soname strings, so frameworks that are
only `dlopen`'d at runtime (Blender loading `libwayland-cursor.so` after
checking `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, for example) get picked up too with no
`DT_NEEDED` entry required.

Detection only flags a framework when it finds a properly versioned soname
such as `libEGL.so.1` or `libwayland-client.so.0`. This keeps Rust binaries
honest. Their string tables merge literals together without NUL separators,
so a real dlopen soname shows up glued to its neighbours like
`...eglWaitSynclibEGL.so.1libEGL.so...`. The version suffix is what tells a
genuine soname apart from prose like `"Library libwayland-client.so could
not be loaded."`.

You can still force any of these explicitly:

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --gl --vulkan --wayland --gtk
```

You can also opt out of a framework that detection or an explicit flag would
otherwise pull in. This matters for a binary built with optional GUI support
that you only ship as a TUI. `amdgpu_top`, for example, links the wgpu and
wayland stacks even though its default mode is a terminal UI:

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./amdgpu_top --no-gl --no-wayland
```

The `--no-*` opt-out always wins over both auto-detection and the matching
`--*` flag. Auto-enabled and suppressed frameworks are both printed so you
know what was decided.

## Extra library search paths

The default resolver walks ldconfig and the NixOS store. If the libraries
you want live somewhere else (cross-compile output, custom prefix), add a
search path:

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --search-path /opt/custom/lib
```

`--search-path` takes precedence over ldconfig and the store, so it's the
best way to pin a specific library version.

## Packing on NixOS

NixOS ships a stub loader at `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` that exists
but refuses to run foreign binaries, printing
`NixOS cannot run dynamically linked executables...`. bundle-libs
handles this automatically:

- Any candidate loader whose canonical path contains `stub-ld` is
  rejected at every resolution tier, so a real glibc from the Nix
  store wins.
- A previously-bundled stub-ld accidentally copied into `lib/` is
  detected (by path or by the `NixOS cannot run` signature inside
  the file) and deleted on the next `bundle-libs` run.
- The bundled glibc loader has its `/nix/store/...` build-time paths
  scrubbed so it can't reach back to a store path that doesn't exist
  on another machine.

You shouldn't need to do anything special. If you see the stub-ld
error anyway, delete the AppDir's `lib/` and re-run `bundle-libs`
with the current `onelf`.

## Cross-libc hygiene

When the target binary is musl and the host is glibc (or vice versa),
bundle-libs can end up copying libraries built against the wrong libc.
Those fail at runtime with confusing "symbol not found" errors.

`--strict-libc` refuses to bundle libraries whose `DT_NEEDED` points at
the wrong libc family, and instead lists them under "Not found":

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --strict-libc
```

Combine with `--search-path` pointing at the right-libc versions to make
the bundle clean.

## Excluding and including

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --exclude libpthread,libdl
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --include libsomething.so.1
```

`--exclude` skips libraries by prefix. `--include` forces a soname into
the resolution queue.

## Stripping

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --strip
```

Runs `strip --strip-unneeded` on each copied library. Saves disk space
(often 20-40 %) at the cost of debuggability.

## Dry run

```bash
onelf bundle-libs ./myapp --dry-run
```

Shows what would be bundled without copying anything.

## GPU / graphics helpers

The granular framework flags:

| Flag | What it bundles |
|------|-----------------|
| `--gl` | `libGL.so`, `libEGL.so`, `libGBM`, `libGLX_mesa`, `libEGL_mesa` |
| `--dri` | Mesa DRI drivers (filtered to your architecture) |
| `--vulkan` | Vulkan ICD drivers + `libvulkan.so.1` |
| `--wayland` | `libwayland-*`, `libdecor-0`, `libxkbcommon`, Wayland client |
| `--gtk` | GSettings schemas under `share/glib-2.0/schemas` |

These are normally enabled automatically. Pass them manually to force-on
when auto-detection misses something. Each has a `--no-*` counterpart
(`--no-gl`, `--no-dri`, `--no-vulkan`, `--no-wayland`, `--no-gtk`) that
forces-off, overriding both auto-detection and the matching `--*` flag.
